glCkSw1bCa8,@amrutaj28,"Samdhish I have some constructive criticism which I hope you'll take well. I seriously didn't like the way you did the following.
1. Laughed at many serious things Imran spoke about with vulnerability. It was very inappropriate, disrespectful and just... didn't make sense to laugh there. Nothing was funny in those points. Like when he spoke about the fan of Mere Brother Ki Dulhan.
2. Interrupted him sooo much and kept looking here and there when he was giving a properly detailed answer. If you don't have enough attention span or focus, please don't interview people like this who have so much depth to offer. It's very rude.
3. Just because Imran is super polite, doesn't mean you judge him directly and ask about how he hasn't spoken a sentence of Hindi. He's already told u about his upbringing. U could have asked the same question in a different way and tone instead of sounding so judgy. Like ""I noticed you don't speak much Hindi, is there a reason for that?"". Not like - ""Man u haven't spoken a single sentence of Hindi! What is this??""

There's a lot more u did wrong but please consider this feedback so that you can get more such good people on ur platform. Otherwise this will really bring ur image down and guests won't be comfortable.",4,2026-01-09T06:57:51Z

f22L9t_G0-A,@ecp9782,"A popular saying says ""a prophet is never accepted in his own town and by his own people""; Or a saying in Hindi ""Ghar ka murgi dal barabar"".

Therefore it would be wiser on the part of the Meghalaya CM to ignore all his political adversaries and steer ahead to do what is best before his conscience for public interest and for Meghalaya to reap good fruits in the years to come.

Those who find the Meghalaya CM as useless are people who choose to ignore all the past CMs and their functions 
and 
mind you; they were over 27 CMs in Meghalaya and there were all together 17 individuals who had become Meghalaya CMs till date.
Some of the 17 had been gracious to their office as CMs and the current Meghalaya CM is among the some of them.

Unfortunately it is a historical fact that the critics chose to brush aside. Nonetheless a historical truth is before us to weigh after we cease to be biased to facts.

The MDA 1&2 government in Meghalaya have done commendable works in many spheres though there are still prospects for further works; 
Yet those who shun to acknowledge the works choose to link all works of the government to debts, which to me is quite not the case to say the least.",0,2026-01-10T06:59:32Z

lsLZYaGSsFA,@isamsharma,"I was smiling throughout this interview, so much so that I didn’t want it to end. I wanted more questions around his thought process and approach to film making and why does he not already have an academy. Samdish does make an interviewee crawl out of comfort zones so unsure why folks are alarmed. I’d have asked so many more questions though :) 
I remember noticing (read discovering) Farhan Akhtar and being remotely interested in finding out about the director of a film, when I watched Lakshya for the first time. My father was in the army then and we watched it in CME, Pune. For me, there was so much resonance with a movie (I was barely a teenager) like the characters, their intentions, the innocence, integrity, and of course SEL songs. The dialogues, the simple yet impactful and realistic scenes, the no-nonsense, the non-climactic and unhyped progress of the story, the non-misogynistic jokes that were hilarious. I still remember some dialogues (Malliahbad ke aam). All of the characters had such depth and were way ahead of that time. I could go on and on tbh. And all of his movies that followed.❤
This man also has my utmost respect for not just believing in feminism now but since the 2000s when no one else really did or atleast appeared to. 
People appreciate this father-son duo now, I’ve been a fan since 2004. 🥹",0,2026-01-05T18:52:05Z

Samdish spoke far too much, often sounding arrogant, and kept trying to prove his points using quick Google searches—like the Escape to Victory reference, which he actually got wrong. Throwing weak or ill-informed arguments (like Mumbai being “less politically aware”) instead of listening didn’t help either.

He wasn’t receptive at all. Big misses: no in-depth conversation on Bhaag Milkha Bhaag or Lakshya. With someone like Farhan Akhtar, this felt like a completely lost opportunity.

Genuine advice to Samdish: be a better listener. You don’t need to know everything. Stop constantly chasing controversy or trying to corner the guest—it really stoops the quality of the conversation.

lsLZYaGSsFA,@hummingbird2309,"Sorry for being overly critical, but this interview was a mess.

Samdish was all over the place, lacking insightful questions and interrupting Faran incessantly and not letting him finish - which was painful to watch. Only to be interrupted by another tangential question. 

I love the quirky nature of questions Samdish usually comes up with, but this one was just a barrage of very random unrelated questions - and very superficial questions at that. In some of the previous interviews Samdish's non conventional random questions led to a deeper understanding of the people he would interview, but it led to disappointment in this one with FA. Samdish was unable to go deeper with FA and could only scratch the surface. Maybe I'm more disappointed with this interview because I was expecting to be completely dazzled from the start by the conversation with FA and Samdish. 

I was also hoping that Samdish would course correct midway and pay some attention to Farhan's body language - (that he was getting uncomfortable and using his hands to cover his mouth - in a way guarding his responses). FA was very kind, wise and a sport to understand his inteviewer and kept playing with Samdish and returning his volleys with lots of enthusiasm, humor and grace.

TRVdHO79Y-M,@earth.buddy09,"Samdish bro seems to be excited about caste classification within tharu community. Let me help you bro. Tharu is community in which number of caste/group exist. They mainly reside in terai region of Nepal and India( UK, UP, Bihar). Because of regional identity i. e terai surrounded by forest they are called tharu. UK tharu community is dominated by राणा tharu (but have other minority tharu too like girnama jugiya, dangra, Rawat, khunka, ). And only राणा tharu claim they are sishodiya rajput descendent of Maharana Pratap.And uttarakhand राणा tharu belong to barah(12) Rana clan. When we talk about UP tharu we see mix of tharu group/caste like Chaudhry, Rana, Dhangra, etc. In bihar we see multiple of caste of tharu luke mahato, das, etc. Earlier they were called by there caste / group name but after government affirmative action these caste/group got documented as tharu. But they all are different. Coming to Nepal tharu in south western terai of Nepal we found राना tharu, central nepal terai chaudhry tharu, dang region of nepal terai we found dangora tharu abd south eastern nepal terai we find other tharu. 
Uttarakhand tharu is different in custom and tradition, lanuage. Similar other tharu of UP, Bihar, Nepal tharu are different in custom and tradition and in lanuage.",0,2025-11-12T06:32:59Z

Look, I didn't see a single thing anywhere about how the situation in Bihar would improve. I only saw that how to remove the BJP from power.

Now, if you meet any Bihar leader, be it Tejashwi Yadav, Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, or any BJP leader, or Prashant Kishor, please ask them one question on my behalf: Do they have any other agenda besides removing the BJP?",1,2025-11-08T15:47:15Z

Mandatory Education must be the fundamental debate & demand. 

we the people - for the people - by the people - education & Enovation must come 1st . No cash benefits or free food without passing class 8 minimum.

Where's Khan Sir & PW ??
Mostly both  young & old leaders of Bihar State cheated the Biharis across the country including in Bihar - 

Biharis are fighting against Biharis - for the Bihar in power- ultimately the leaders of the Bihar are enjoying their life in king size - for past 75 years.

just check ✅ it out this 

All leaders worked in the last 76 years or rather still are working for their own credentials, financial independence & personal power 

Why is still possible for anyone to take the law & order in hand and challenge the Govt law & order machineries openly for the past 75 years - just like  in Sudden & Kenya.. 

Let's check ✅  out the reality 

Is it impossible - 
to make & create good Infrastructures roads for the people, for business & tourism, and to create smooth logistics support systems 

Is it impossible - 
to generate electricity & supply street lights properly with CCTV camera 

Is it impossible - 
again to provide safety 🦺🛟 & security booth by through appointment of local retired Agniveer in every village & at the key check points - to make people feel safe & secured. 

Nalanda University - where is initiative from the authority concerns to make the institution famous again - 

is it impossible 
to create 700 Nalanda Shiksha Vidyalya Kendra - in Bihar to make it mandatory for every child to complete their minimum education up to class 8 ( skill base ) with AI 

but these things were made impossible by the peoples of Bihar for Bihar by its leaders. 

Conclusion is - Bihar people must decide - either to accept the money & free food or the development work & growth 📈 

you need to stay at your place to make it Grow, to see it grow 😉🪴 - you are coming to state for vote and going back to another place , will not help to change the situation in your favour, and peoples will continue to treat you 2nd class citizens wherever you go and leaders will continue to exploit the voters.

You’re trying to adjust between Dhruv Rathhee , Deshbhaktetc in a different way . You’re not real you’re sick brother , you took interview of CPI(ML)L that group which massacred hundreds of innocent people just in a decade , you’re endorsing those mfs .

But when asked about the birhu tola community he was dismissive of them and said that since the parents are illiterate their children aren't going to school. And you could see he held some negative emotions towards them. Meanwhile Suman Kumar, starts with prideful statements about bihar and its people. He refuses to acknowledge any issues in the society. But when asked about the birhu tola community he has the same positive sentiments towards them and tries to talk about the good side that they are going to school but some teachers aren't teaching.

Standing face-to-face before society is the bravest yet hardest thing a person can do in India. I recently watched a movie in which the father of the hero was a dancer, and his son was ashamed of him. That character faced so much harassment in his day-to-day life that's what motivated me to watch this interview. After watching this interview, I felt genuinely happy seeing how he is so proud and satisfied with his work.

यहां एक संक्षिप्त, प्रभावशाली और भावनात्मक हिन्दी ड्राफ्ट तैयार किया गया है जिसे प्रशांत किशोर अपने भाषण या साक्षात्कार में इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं। इसमें *रिचर्ड बाख* की किताब **Illusions** की “leap of faith” (विश्वास की छलांग) की अवधारणा को बिहार की मौजूदा स्थिति और *जन सुराज आंदोलन* के संदर्भ में जोड़ा गया है

""रिचर्ड बाख की किताब *Illusions* में एक कहानी है — सागर की गहराई में रहने वाला एक छोटा जीव, जो रोज़ एक ही तरीके से तैरता रहता था। उसके आस-पास सब कह रहे थे — ‘जैसा सदीयों से चल रहा है, वैसा ही चलने दो।’ लेकिन एक दिन उस जीव ने सोचा — ‘अगर ऊपर उठ कर देखूं तो शायद सागर की रौशनी कुछ और हो।’ उसने अपनी जान पर खेल के सागर की सतह की ओर छलांग लगाई — **विश्वास की छलांग (Vishwas ki Chhalang)**। और जैसे ही वो सतह पर पहुंचा, पहली बार उसने सूरज की रोशनी देखी।""

""आज बिहार भी उसी मोड़ पर खड़ा है। बरसों से वही गलियाँ, वही नेता, वही वादे। सब कह रहे हैं — ‘बदलाव नहीं हो सकता।’ लेकिन जन सुराज यही कह रहा है — अगर हम सब एक बार **विश्वास की छलांग** लगाएँ, तो बिहार भी उस उजाले को देख सकता है जो आज तक सागर की गहराई में छिपा है।""

""हमने न सत्ता से डर कर शुरू किया, न हार-जीत की गिनती के लिए। हमने भरोसा किया कि बिहार के लोग अपने भाग्य के खुद माली बन सकते हैं। जैसे कहावत है — ‘जिहनवा उठ गइल, ओके कौन रोकी?’ अगर जनता ठान ले, तो कोई ताकत उसे पीछे नहीं खींच सकती।""

""तो भाइयों और बहनों, अब डरने का नहीं, छलांग लगाने का समय है — *विश्वास की छलांग*। क्योंकि बदलाव वही करता है जो अंधेरे को किस्मत नहीं मानता, बल्कि रौशनी खोजने निकल पड़ता है।""

***

यह संस्करण भावनात्मक रूप से गहरा है, ग्रामीण और शहरी दोनों वर्गों को जोड़ सकता है, और “leap of faith” को “विश्वास की छलांग” या “आस्था के छलाँग” की तरह लोकभाषा में उतारता है जो भाषण में बहुत प्रभावी लग सकता है",0,2025-10-18T09:40:08Z

यहां एक संक्षिप्त, प्रभावशाली और भावनात्मक हिन्दी ड्राफ्ट तैयार किया गया है जिसे प्रशांत किशोर अपने भाषण या साक्षात्कार में इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं। इसमें *रिचर्ड बाख* की किताब **Illusions** की “leap of faith” (विश्वास की छलांग) की अवधारणा को बिहार की मौजूदा स्थिति और *जन सुराज आंदोलन* के संदर्भ में जोड़ा गया है

""रिचर्ड बाख की किताब *Illusions* में एक कहानी है — सागर की गहराई में रहने वाला एक छोटा जीव, जो रोज़ एक ही तरीके से तैरता रहता था। उसके आस-पास सब कह रहे थे — ‘जैसा सदीयों से चल रहा है, वैसा ही चलने दो।’ लेकिन एक दिन उस जीव ने सोचा — ‘अगर ऊपर उठ कर देखूं तो शायद सागर की रौशनी कुछ और हो।’ उसने अपनी जान पर खेल के सागर की सतह की ओर छलांग लगाई — **विश्वास की छलांग (Vishwas ki Chhalang)**। और जैसे ही वो सतह पर पहुंचा, पहली बार उसने सूरज की रोशनी देखी।""

""आज बिहार भी उसी मोड़ पर खड़ा है। बरसों से वही गलियाँ, वही नेता, वही वादे। सब कह रहे हैं — ‘बदलाव नहीं हो सकता।’ लेकिन जन सुराज यही कह रहा है — अगर हम सब एक बार **विश्वास की छलांग** लगाएँ, तो बिहार भी उस उजाले को देख सकता है जो आज तक सागर की गहराई में छिपा है।""

""हमने न सत्ता से डर कर शुरू किया, न हार-जीत की गिनती के लिए। हमने भरोसा किया कि बिहार के लोग अपने भाग्य के खुद माली बन सकते हैं। जैसे कहावत है — ‘जिहनवा उठ गइल, ओके कौन रोकी?’ अगर जनता ठान ले, तो कोई ताकत उसे पीछे नहीं खींच सकती।""

""तो भाइयों और बहनों, अब डरने का नहीं, छलांग लगाने का समय है — *विश्वास की छलांग*। क्योंकि बदलाव वही करता है जो अंधेरे को किस्मत नहीं मानता, बल्कि रौशनी खोजने निकल पड़ता है।""

rabies bahut khtarnak disease he,  ek baar bukar aaega, 100% mar jata he. koi bachta nahin. 

me vaccine se bach gaya. insurance company ke support bhi tha. 2 saal ka support.

yadi india me sab logon ko, sab kutton ko medical support mil jata to baat thik he.  rabies ki problem khatam ho jaegi.

Don't they listen the number of dog deaths and dog injuries by road accidents? 
The decision taken by the court is also too harsh and the government and the MCD should take  responsibility, and remove these stray dogs from the roads. But this isn't possible as everyone of us know, that how will the dogs be taken after they will be removed.

Ask them about life, it's lessons, it's struggles.
These are already fragile people, going through depression, passing away of most of their friends and siblings, many on medications. 
Try not to make their happiness wither with questions of death. Giving an interview is an exciting time for them also to gain respect from their grand children. Don't spoil it with questions of their life's end approaching.",0,2025-12-26T16:49:38Z

Listening to him speak gave me a sense of peace and pride. I'm a 12th-grade student, but for a moment I wished I could meet him just to say thank you and give him a hug for his service and wisdom. It felt so good to hear a narrative where Muslims weren’t stereotyped, and where freedom fighters and leaders were respected for who they truly were not what Gen Z hears in twisted ways. His words were powerful, and the lady in the video just Mashallah, such grace and beauty..! Thank you for bringing such wholesome content. May Allah bless them both with good health and happiness.

z_0AsDS_p9A,@parthatre-02,"Please never stop this series—it’s always on my binge-watch playlist. This show truly enlightens us about rural India, where people struggle to meet their basic needs, surviving on just ₹200–300 a day while battling illnesses. In contrast, living here in Mumbai, I see how casually some of us spend ₹1,000–2,000 a day. I belong to a middle-class family, yet I’ve heard that in some pubs people spend ₹1–2 lakh in a single night. This series highlights the stark divide between rural and urban India.

The so-called “$3 trillion economy” holds little meaning until rural India begins to see real development. In the video, when the man says he earns ₹100 a month for six months (just ₹600), and then loses ₹200 on injections, it’s heartbreaking. It shows how vulnerable people are—both medically and economically—in this so-called Vishwaguru Bharat. 😢",4,2025-08-23T17:52:28Z

Minerals of Bihar were looted when Jharkhand was part of Bihar by the freight equalization policy of 1952, which was implemented by India until 1993, to the detriment of Bihar's development. Then, Lalu Gunjal Raaj came into power, and subsequently, Bihar was looted. Still, Bihar came in 14th in GDP and has a high growth rate, and now, Bihar is not using its overpopulation and cheap and hard-working labourers in the development of Bihar by setting up industries and investing in Bihar. If Bihar uses its hard-working labourers for the development of Bihar, it will come under the top 5 in GDP. If Bihar is developed, then other states will cry due to cheap labour, especially industries in other states. They exploit us(Bihari) through low salaries, long work shifts, and also do racism against Biharis, etc. They abuse us to work there instead of taking advantage of us to develop states (They have a dual face), and sometimes we do not feel safe in other states.",1,2025-09-09T05:33:21Z

As far as my history is concerned all this started after the revolt of 1857. That’s when the seeds of hatred were sown, there was no hum unke Ghar nahi khayenge, we would eat in each others houses and share food and festivals and life.",1,2025-09-02T19:05:18Z

YLURkSPMvGM,@BhaskarBhushanBhaiyaTripleB,"Just for the subaltern perspective- Please please do this more, if you can. 
Only the people who have seen our past and are in the present will have to be gently nudged and asked for a world that we haven't seen.Then only people of today would see and believe that truth isn't monolithic and that what was perhaps just a small part of their life has gained prominence now and as with everything, it is trying to gain strength further and that everything is a cycle of time and that there's no left and right but a centre for everything, around which everything revolves and evolves.And that will be one of the many greatest services to the cause of democracy of this country,for it will keep symbols and names alive. 
I just want that if there's a binary as it has turned out to be- let both sides be as strong as possible and the last two interviews of the nonagenarian veterans puts my faith on the system of people that breeds trust in the civilization values that go beyond the binaries of politics and cultural or economic trends, or beyond the trends of perspective - based time frames.

📍 The Mokokchung Ayatai Massacre | Nagaland 1994 Tragedy
On December 27, 1994, the peaceful town of Mokokchung in Nagaland witnessed one of the darkest chapters in its history. Known as the Ayatai Massacre, this horrifying incident unfolded when the Indian Army's 10th Assam Rifles, under the pretext of counterinsurgency, launched a brutal operation that led to the killing of 12 innocent civilians, widespread arson, and destruction of over 90 homes and shops.

YLURkSPMvGM,@zakirali8721,"It’s always heartwarming to hear stories from that time. My grandfather, along with his family and cousins, migrated from Delhi to Lahore and eventually settled in Karachi. Like so many others, they were caught in the chaos of a partition that was rushed and unplanned by the British — a decision that left people divided, wounded, and in conflict. Sadly, some of those wounds still haven’t healed.

But today, there’s a new generation in Pakistan — one that doesn’t see Indians as enemies. Thanks to social media and a more connected world, they’re more open-minded and better informed about the past. They understand what went wrong and believe it’s time to move forward. Peace and prosperity go hand in hand — you can’t have one without the other.

Honestly, many of us in Pakistan feel like India is going through what we did in the 1980s — when Zia-ul-Haq pushed radical ideas into society under the shadow of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. That path brought nothing but division, fear, and long-term damage. Indian leaders and media should realize that spreading hate, pushing fake news, and fueling war-like sentiment around the clock will only hold the region back.

What we truly need — on both sides — is vision and courage. Let’s look at how Europe came out of the destruction of World War II. They let go of old hatred, chose cooperation, and built a peaceful and thriving region. South Asia can do the same — if we’re willing to open our hearts, learn from history, and build a better future together.",5,2025-07-12T17:32:37Z

9ogf-LiYdlc,@newspeoplekashmir,"मैं हमेशा मोदीजी की आलोचना करता था, लेकिन आज मैं उनके बारे में कुछ कम ज्ञात अच्छी बातें साझा करूंगा। क्या आपको पता था:

मोदी ने दो बार जन्म लिया - पहला 29 अगस्त 1949 को (उनकी डिग्री पर) और दूसरा 17 सितंबर 1950 को (सार्वजनिक डोमेन में उपलब्ध)।

1950 में पैदा हुए मोदी ने 6 साल की उम्र में वडनगर रेलवे स्टेशन पर चाय बेची थी, लेकिन वडनगर में सिर्फ पटरियां ही गुजरती थीं। वास्तविक रेलवे स्टेशन 1973 में बनाया गया था, जब मोदी 23 वर्ष के थे।

आपातकाल के दौरान मोदी भूमिगत थे, लेकिन उन्होंने 1978 में दिल्ली विश्वविद्यालय से स्नातक किया।

मोदी ने दिल्ली विश्वविद्यालय से स्नातक प्रमाणपत्र के बिना 1983 में गुजरात विश्वविद्यालय से संपूर्ण राजनीति विज्ञान में परास्नातक किया।

मोदी दुनिया के इकलौते ऐसे शख्स हैं, जिनके पास पूरे राजनीति विज्ञान में मास्टर्स डिग्री है। गुजरात विश्वविद्यालय के प्रोफेसरों को भी 2014 के बाद इस कोर्स के बारे में पता चला।

मोदी ने मास्टर्स ऑफ एंटियर पॉलिटिकल साइंस की डिग्री में अकेले प्रवेश लिया, अकेले परीक्षा दी और अकेले डिग्री ली। अभी तक किसी भी छात्र या प्रोफेसर ने मोदी के साथ पढ़ाई करने का दावा नहीं किया है.

भारत में कंप्यूटर के आने से पहले भी मोदी की डिग्री कंप्यूटर से छपती थी।

1978 में मोदी की डिग्री से पहले और उसके 10 साल बाद भी, डिग्री विश्वविद्यालय के कर्मचारियों द्वारा हाथ से लिखी जाती थी।

1992 में माइक्रोसॉफ्ट द्वारा पेटेंट कराया गया फॉन्ट 1978 में मोदी की डिग्री को प्रिंट करने के लिए इस्तेमाल किया गया था।

मोदी की डिग्री रविवार को छपी थी, जब कार्यालय बंद थे।

इसी में से समय निकालकर उन्होंने 1971 के बांग्लादेश मुक्ति आंदोलन में भी हिस्सा लिया था!

एक और सबसे ज़रूरी बात रह गई 
मोदी जी ने 35 साल भिक्षा मांग कर पेट भरा था।
भिक्षाटन से समय निकाल कर वे देशाटन को भी चले जाते थे।
हॉलीवुड के यूनिवर्सल स्टूडियो और पेरिस में एफिल टावर के सामने कोट पहन कर फोटो भी खिंचाते थे।

अगर आप लोग अभी भी नहीं मानते कि मोदी जी अलौकिक हैं, तो आप देशद्रोही हैं!

नशा शराब का हो या अंधभक्ति का एक ना एक दिन उतरता जरूर है !

upJOKBvqfzg,@omkargaikwad1615,"What's the problem with leftist and communists in India they are more cared and loving towards the Muslims who voted for partion and didn't went with the mandate and the Hindu who tolerated the partion of their holy land and adjusting with the same culprits but has to go constitutional to do justice to the past. Hindus offered muslims money and land for freeing their holy sites but Muslims after dividing the land still wanted to hold on the holiest sites of Hindus. Brittas was shocked by the falling of dome which has nothing holy in islam but Hindus should not be agitated by seeing their holy sites occupied by people by same community who divided thier nation and didn't went to Muslim land. Where in world you see such example that Vast Majority fighting the case to acquire their holy sites from the minority community. Britaas don't see secularism that Hindus fought a court case for 200 years for just single temple demanding justice. Sad reality of Hindus that we are not the Monsters which people like potary us, if only we would be like that we would have free our all holy sites. The Great Hindu Civilization survived for many years now but this Democracy will lead us to our coffins.",1,2025-10-10T05:31:18Z

Just a question though, I am confused, where does the Uniform Civil code speak about mandatory registering live-in relationships? Registering of long term live-in relationships is done across the world, but that is only when ppl choose to do it, especially if they want to have legal rights to property etc. like a spouse would have, however it is not mandated. So a man and a woman could choose to do it, if they mutually agree, but they are not obligated by law to. It is mostly in self interest. But is it not the same in India?",2,2025-06-28T07:58:49Z

eDYrUWkqpOA,@MultiDiig,"1. Needy hai aaiyash nahi, card bana do. I side with his logic, rational.
2. I don't agree with reservation or quota in govt jobs, this will create a new problem and is senseless.
3. Domestic violence can never be justified but then again the victims on the other side only have Atul Subhash option, he is probably waiting for justice in heaven right now. 
4. Men are demonised by politics to a level that nowadays a dog or cat gets more love and care than a man, we are seeing that the married once are no better   and men never get justice, the only exception being Sonam Raghuvanshi's & Muskan's husband who got justice only because the crime was murder which doesn't put gender into the equation. 
5. Harayana has a bad reputation when it comes to treating women no matter how many Dangals Aamir Khan makes. these single middle aged or elderly men get married to - women from poor states are bought like commodities and shared among brothers as property - that's a common perception, I can't comment on the ground realities but perception and intuition play a crucial role on how a cetain race, demography, geography is viewed by others.",1,2025-08-13T23:11:23Z

My point being, the public who throws trash on roads, I have done it, u have done it. One should stop that on a individual level, people should be conscious because nobody comes from Mumbai to throw trash in Delhi, it's the delhites themselves. 
new government may evolve plans and  also implement them to clean up the place, but after that not making it worse again is mostly in hand of people because ultimately ""government"" is nothing but people like u and me, who happen to take the responsibility of governance.",2,2025-02-09T04:56:50Z

XwWWe5k2wlE,@sumesh-g7e,"Very good video. These are indeed real and pressing issues that affect people on the ground. But the root cause often remains the same — a lack of understanding that change has to start at the local level.

People need to realize that it’s their local MLA or district representative who holds the key to implementing solutions in their area. National leaders like Modi, Rahul, or major parties like BJP and Congress may introduce schemes with good intentions, but they can’t personally ensure implementation in every village or town.

For any national scheme to succeed, it’s the local officials — whether in UP, Delhi, Haryana, or Bihar — who must carry it forward and ensure it benefits their communities. With India’s massive population and diverse cultural landscape, one-size-fits-all policies will always fall short.

Take agricultural issues as an example: what affects farmers in Punjab might be entirely different from what farmers in Andhra Pradesh face. That’s why local governance and accountability are critical. No one from the Centre is going to come down and fix problems for us. The real responsibility lies with us — at the district and, at most, the state level — to push for progress and uplift our fellow citizens.",1,2025-04-17T09:59:21Z

I wanted to bring your attention to a serious crisis faced by the employees of Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd. (HEC), Ranchi. The company has not paid salaries for the past 26-28 months, pushing its workers into extreme financial distress. Many employees are struggling to meet basic needs, and local shopkeepers have stopped giving them essential supplies on credit due to unpaid dues.

The situation is worsening every day, and their voices are not being heard. It would be incredibly helpful if you could cover this issue and interview HEC employees to highlight their struggles. Your platform can bring much-needed awareness and potentially push for action.",0,2025-03-25T07:58:04Z

If you connect the dots its quite evident
Modi won election and one point was black money. You need to understand what black money is.
1. Black money is the money in circuation in parallel economies, channels which are not tracable by govt as they are not govt regulated.

2. 4 ways were - property market, gold making charges, hawala ( comodities middle man) and political funding.
3. Lets forget the last one for obvious reason.
4. First amendment in rules related to property registery tax immideatly crippled that channel.
5. Second the tax on gold jewlry making crippled the precious metal channel
Then remained one channel which was the baap channel hawala, comodities middle man. Most if not all black money (sizable amounts) had one option for circulation.
6. Then came note bandi which forced the hidden cash to move into that channel
7. Then came the farm law in 2020 to suppress those hawala middle men in mandis ( not correct way to go about it and i think it would have opened other pandoras box of corporate greed)

So think note bandi was not random.",0,2025-10-29T09:41:40Z
F9L1CCnw2b4,@divyalattoo,"6:14 Right left is so unimaginative, we were multi polar always, somehow we have to regress to bipolarity in ideology due to influence of a young civilisation. 
we should be the one coining ideological terms instead of adopting them with zero introspection. Incapabiility of Indias intellectual, they are parrots.

 Red blue, left right, conservative libral. Only 2 packages to select from. A list of values you subscribe to even if the list have contradictory values.

I will give example - ""we are absolute pro-life, so we are anti abortion (right) and pro gun control (left)"", the falacy and problem of 2 side only kind of approch is, it kills the brain cells which would have led to a section of people with the ideological value such as, but such though can not even come to the mind of person that have yo choose from only 2 options and they have to subscribe to all values listed on one side. 
One side will quote religious text to tell you how precious life is and system will take care of chid born out of rape, giving women no choice but will also defend gun voilence death as right they have to protect themself, completly skiping on how system like in previous case will protect them and they dont need AR rifels. This create a subconceious dissonance in persons ideological body. Makes it unstable, prone to extremes and render them incapable of having any power during debates or dialogues.

Left righ, is such a youngster civilisation ideology that a culture which gave out so many religions during partial theocratic society should just look at it as middle school children debating for first time.",0,2025-10-29T07:31:53Z

Now we don't know what and why happened. We have lost the pleasure of closure, we don't know what happened to electoral bonds we get statistics from Amit Shah repeatedly.

We don't know the foundation layers of Sangh or who tilted towards the Sangh post Manmohan Singh realize what they lost as articulate guys. What are the pro bhakt intellectual blog writers doing now, did they get rewarded, they have stopped quoting P. Sainath.

We don't know which side Swati Maliwal presently is.

We don't know what's the psychological compulsion or syndrome that made Modi or Kejriwal build a new house.

We don't know if Modi is the chosen one by western power, Modi got a medal from Trump of ""being better negotiator than himself."" I remember a time when industries would have favorite union leaders leading their workers.

I only meet Muslim friends over a drink, even he prefers it that way, one another close bhakt friend prefers to meet us over drink.

About the bhakt, I fail to understand why he is still a close friend to us whom we can individually run down and he takes no offense and we would laugh dying, but moment Modi crops up he would kill us for what he believes about Modi.

I called that bhakt friend recently saying that Modi is really the greatest guy, because of Modi US spent 4 lakh per person to transport illegal Indian migrants to India, that too in defense plane of US. It took some time for him to understand the satire behind what I was saying.

I see food security and Pakka house being provided to tribals living in my village, I can only relate it to China's leadership where the leadership is autocratic to get profit but is sincere in provisioning better lifestyle to the masses, we don't see videos of homeless as of USA, China has the highest domestic tourist inflow, one important difference is they don't have discussion/debate of internal ""other"".
Once the national narrative is in BJP's control they may give up the ""other"" debate/discussion.

The editorial driven politics is out of window, it's repeated social media prompts that work. Everything untouchable can be normalized in social media.

The Indian economic order is changing, Infosys, Pepsi, Coke and etc. are no more securing their employees' old age, these guys' old age is secured by real estate soaring prices for which they slogged to pay the EMI, they can sell city house and shift to suburban house.

The BEST in Mumbai is not disbursing gratuity after retirement naturally, one has to run pillar to post, or plead in court, Sharad Rao's union which was considered neutral which did not prefer lock out confrontation has become powerless too.

We can fall like pack of cards or survive as a country, the gig economy may get better and normalize, the 12 to 14 hours work in gig may go or may become a norm.

dC_gV1yB1AA,@1st_cypher,"The Ottoman Empire imposed harsh inequalities on other faiths. Non-Muslims were treated as second-class citizens, forced to pay the jizya tax, restricted from high offices, and subject to religious courts that favored Muslims. At times, Christian boys were taken through the devshirme system to be converted and trained as soldiers, and communities often faced pressure to convert for social or economic survival. In comparison, Indonesia today is far more pluralistic, but still not perfectly fair to all religions. Minority groups may struggle to get permits for churches or temples, face mob pressure from radical groups, and risk blasphemy accusations if they accidentally offend religious sentiments. Atheism is not legally protected, and in some conservative regions, religious minorities feel socially marginalized. Thus, while Indonesia is more tolerant than the Ottoman system, both have had periods where other faiths experienced discrimination, restrictions, and unequal treatment.",0,2025-11-17T07:18:48Z

if in rail industry we can have engine to carry distance at 100km/hr
then we cannot see in road industry
if this speed milestone is attend then we can cover distance twice 
for this will be roads and infrastructure
but now time has arrived where in old trucks which runs 30km/hr or 40km/hr which 
compared to other trucks runs at 80km/hr must be discontinued

As we are using machines which are just incurring cost driven models 
this can be taken at IIT and IIM and where they can present the case study

for longer distance one prefers swift innova sedan car compared and not maruti omni and tata nano

 

As no truck are safety compliant which are running then for this we need to have safety measure or compliant
At first we need to have all vehicles which are safety compliants and maintain std in early days if it going 
have huge cost then we need to ask for subsidy we need to get subsidy approved for safety of drivers 
so they can drive safel


We need to see attleast 10 diffeent type of safety compliant cabinet for drivers

Ministers also need to wave green flags after redesigning and implementing such products in mkt for railway we are sble to see green flags waved off every month or in 15 days 

likewise for road logistics also would like to see 


We need to redesign the product like we have BE6 of Mahindra competing with Tesla Cyber truck



you compare any industry in long run if break even is notvattend in less than 3.5 years then it doesnt sustain 

after a point there is maintainence  cost which keeps adding 

Bus services volvo 9600 attends breqk even less than 2.5 years because of avg tkt size is high compared to other players in mkt

how bulky tiresome timedricen will be a corporate employee in year 2025 carry his typing machine to carry out his day to day work im India to be at par among others players in mkt

All the states agreed to be a part of India. Hence ur country is so big. Or else it wouldn't have been. If the govts of this country whether its BJP or congress hates us so much then please give us freedom. Manipur has been burning since 2 years. Nothing done. Bengal asking for president's rule since 1 year. But nothing done. Flood like situation every year in the whole of North-East. But never declared a national emergency. BSF is controlled by Central govt but never taken any strict measures to make a proper border along the states that share a border with Bangladesh. China taking over villages one by one slowly along the borders of Arunachal Pradesh. But govt still sleeping or rather I would say give a damn about the people of that state. If the govt of this country isn't capable of managing this part of India. Then better separate this part. We will take care of ourselves. We live, we die. Its our own problem.

Greeting. You are an exceptional man. Now I can feel you are achieved all the new things you know. I have lots of aphorism with categorical imperative sentences but not legitimate at the same time. When I saw your interviews I can't articulate my words because it's really inspiring. You can't replicating yourself. When I watched your interview I can't take any kinds of solemn oath. Because your work is so detailed man. You gave eternal glorification all the time and i really enjoyed and appreciate your thoughts of construction man.

I find myself so lucky to hear and see Mr. Benegal. I missed the chance to see him in person, he visited Jehangir Art Gallery where my dad had his exhibition going. Ofc I was young and did not really regret it back then.

but i would also like to bring to the light a few things about samdish, the way samdish enacts himself during the interview is so childish, he is trying it on purpose but the thing is it messes up with the vibe of the personality of the interviewee. It is also a bit irritating to see an amateruish podcast interviewer, I still feel samdish can also become a bit more subtle and take his demeanour to a pristine level.

I truly wish Irrfan Khan was still with us to be a part of such an interview. The way Shoojit Sircar spoke about him made me feel his presence too. We all miss him dearly.",3,2025-02-28T10:15:49Z

Looking forward to his book. Great Interview Samdish. You are doing a good job of capturing these light hearted moments with some of our best political leaders.

I am from tehsil: darhal, district: Rajouri ,jammu and Kashmir and currently doing my graduation from IISER Pune. because my father is in army so I am lucky to see many state of India like rajasathan,mahrastra,jarkhand. I love to see the diversity and culture that every place I see have and what the best part is no matter how much they lives in poverty their faces are always smiling.,toddlers play with joy on streets, grounds or in valleys . how I see jammu Kashmir is another India inside of India where you not only see the city of temples with thousand of temples but see mosques with his own architecture and story you see churches and shrines also,you see Buddhist,christian,hindus,muslim with in them a diverse community of Kashmiri,dogri,gujjar and Pahari and this community share all different religion you see Kashmiri pandit and Kashmiri muslim, you see Dogri muslim and hindu ,you see Pahari buddhist, muslim,hindu same goes with Gujjar and similar like India the problems of different places in jammu and Kashmir is different like for some places water ,electricity and better opportunities and jobs is the problem, for some better infrastructure, for some sustainable development, for some its will be the heavy rain of monsoon and for some its heavy snowfall and for some 40 degree + temperature of jammu city 

I thankyou for showing the real side of jammu and Kashmir that we really see lack in our national media and also want to mention I am jealous from Bashir that he get a chance to meet you. yah I know he deserve more and I pray Allah that almighty complete his ambitions and he will become ips one day.

What is frustrating here is that in spite of being a son of a powerful person, this guy who is romanticising their story today couldn't do anything for them back then and left for dubai and cut off all ties with them for a long period of time. Unbelievable. And it's equally frustrating that hindus like mr. Kaul and his daughter, despite being thrown out of their homes in Kashmir, kept doing things that justified nothing but stupidity on their part?? People don't really learn from their mistakes.

After this interview i really dont care about his political affiliations. All i know is, he’s got a great experience in mimicry of diff Indian accents, one of the most honest Kashmiri politicians ive ever seen, with crystal clear views & affiliations and at last a guy with an excellent vibe as a politician.

You should have asked about 
1. Radicalism in Kashmir when there was not a bjp government 
2. Separatist movements 
3. His parties involvement in separatist movement in 1991 
4. Sending of party workers for training across the border under the command of Farooq Abdullah.( Qoute from india today)
5. Alignment of his party lies to which party in central 
6. Why it seems all they try to do is stay in power and have that creamy layer for themselves without acknowledgement of alignment with any party or ideology and adjust to party which suits them best according to the need of the time 
6. Breaking of his party in 90s
7. Congress involvement in the breaking of it.
 
Please don't mold what you are doing in a form of entertainment keep it as light as you want the questions should be at the epicenter of all these otherwise what you are doing is of no use

What if.. since he had so smartly analysed his previous loss,
he tried to do the same thing that he realised helped his opponents to win the elections against him.

We live in a India where we have built 15 AIIMS in last 10 yrs so that every lower middle class or poor person can get quality and cheap treatment plus it has increased the govt medical collede seat also. The problem of open defecation was not hidden from anyone during UPA era. The report by UN on open defecation was indeed a embarrassemet for Indians but from there on people especially the ones living in rural area started getting proper toilets. According to a survey this scheme of govt to build toilets saved upto RS 50000 of each family in rural places coz now they were getting less affected by diseases. Just imagine during UPA era we didn't even had proper toilets, this was actually an embarrassemet for Indians. Don't you know about one nation one subscription.

KjodhqJVFtE,@Pal.Garmesh,"In a conversation that felt like a dream, I sat down with the legendary actor Rajit Kapur. His name might not ring a bell, but his contribution to Hindi Cinema is nothing less than art. Whether it's his portrayal of detective Byomkesh Bakshi in the 90s TV series or his role as a father of the spy in the 2018 film Raazi, Rajit has never failed to impress his audience.

Rajit talks about it all, from being a perennial face in Shyam Benegal movies to adapting the ever-changing medium of acting. He shares his insights on the world of theatre, his current favourite play & his most memorable experience of watching other artists perform. From being nervous before every shot to the strength he derives from his co-actors, Rajit also sheds light on his life on the film sets. 

Rajit gave me a peek into his travel diary, stories from his childhood and walked me through his life journey. But it doesn't end here. He left me with a song and that's all I needed to complete my #fan​-boy moment (which was precisely the point of this whole Interview). 

So before I write everything in the description, please go ahead and watch: My Intriguing Conversation With The Only Actor To Have Played Modi, Nehru and Gandhi | Unfiltered By Samdish ft. Rajit Kapur | Powered by Woodland

It was a bit jarring and made it hard for the interviewee to really get their points across. I get that time is limited and all, but it would be better to let them finish before moving on to the next question.

Sat Sri Akal, Namaskar, Assalamualaikum, Good Morning/Evening. Arshad Warsi was in Delhi and so were we. One fine afternoon, we picked him up in our Range Rover (yeah, yeah, yeah, it was rented) and landed up in a Japanese restaurant.

और बातों का सिलसिला जो शुरू हुआ तो चलता ही गया. We talked our hearts out over Sushi and 'Japan ka glamorous bhajia'. Those 3-4 hours were a deep dive into his personality, worldview, take on cinema, aspirations, relationship with children and wife, many crazy stories, and much more (writing everything here will kill the anticipation, you know).

So, take a deep breath. Breathe in. Breathe out. And now let yourself immerse in this conversation. See you on the other side.

With Woodland on our side, presenting you the almost uncut conversation with one and only Arshad Warsi.

QWGX5-1YsWA,@Rajnish-Choubey2026,"Content is user-generated and unverified. i am clinically mad so u can ignore too.
Why Samdish Bhatia Is The Best Interviewer In The World
Not best in India. Best in the world.

Here's why.

1. He Lets Silence Do The Work
3 hours and 14 minutes with Arshad Warsi.

Most interviewers panic when there's a pause. They fill it with their own voice, their own cleverness, their own need to be seen.

Samdish sits. Waits. Lets Arshad think. Lets Arshad wander. Lets the conversation breathe.

Example: When Arshad talks about his parents dying, Samdish doesn't immediately jump in with sympathy or the next question. He waits. And in that silence, Arshad goes deeper.

""My father had bone cancer. My mother was on dialysis every week. That was bad time... very bad time. I was working, doing choreography, earning barely anything. What I earned, dialysis. It just... kept going.""

The silence created space for truth.

2. He Asks Questions That Reveal Character, Not Just Facts
Not: ""Tell us about your career.""

Instead: ""Last time you lost your sense of humor?""

That single question reveals more about Arshad than any career retrospective could. Shows how his mind works. Shows what matters to him.

Not: ""What are your hobbies?""

Instead: ""Do you fart in front of your wife?""

Everyone laughed. But Arshad's answer revealed his entire worldview about propriety, boundaries, relationships.

""There's a difference between mouth and ass... if you don't know the difference then what can I say.""

Character revealed in absurdity.

3. He Doesn't Perform. He Converses.
Watch the video. Samdish barely speaks. When he does, it's short. Natural. Building on what was just said.

No ""As I was saying earlier..."" No ""That reminds me of something fascinating..."" No making himself the star.

Just: ""Tell me more."" ""What happened then?"" ""And?""

The ratio: Arshad speaks 85% of the time. Samdish speaks 15%.

That's the sign of a great interviewer. The guest is the star. The guest does the revealing. The interviewer is invisible infrastructure making it possible.

4. He Prepares So He Can Improvise
Samdish knows everything about Arshad. Watches old interviews. Knows the films, the controversies, the family history.

But he never shows off that knowledge. He uses it to know when to push, when to redirect, when to let something go.

Example: When Arshad starts talking about his relationship with money, Samdish knows exactly when to ask about the motor home, the farm, the bikes. Not because he's following a script, but because he knows the context so well he can follow the flow.

That's preparation serving spontaneity.

5. He Goes Where Others Won't
On religion: Arshad: ""The more people stop following religion, the better the world becomes.""

Most interviewers would panic. Change subject. Protect the guest. Protect themselves.

Samdish: ""You're not scared saying this openly?""

Then lets Arshad explain fully. No judgment. No panic. Just curiosity.

On porn: ""When did you first watch porn?""

Arshad laughs. Answers honestly. Says he's never been interested, it bores him.

That honesty only happens because Samdish asked without shame, without judgment, without performing shock.

6. He Finds The Human Behind The Performance
Three hours with Arshad and you learn:

He hates shooting in heat but did two films back-to-back after COVID because people needed work
His biggest insecurity is sudden death before his kids are settled (because of his own experience losing parents)
He doesn't love himself enough - admits he doesn't take care of his health, doesn't have vanity
He processes characters 24/7, can't turn it off, calls people in the middle of the night with ideas
He thinks acting should be invisible - if you can see the acting, it's bad acting
He wants to direct but needs to make more money first so he can afford not working during production
His fear isn't about himself - it's about failing the people who depend on him
None of this is PR spin. None of this is talking points. All of this is human truth emerging because Samdish created the space for it.

7. He Understands The Power Of Small Questions
""Do you dye your hair?""
""How much money do you want to earn?""
""Can you fart in front of your wife?""
""What's your biggest flaw?""

Small questions. Intimate questions. Questions that seem trivial but actually reveal everything about how someone sees themselves and the world.

Arshad's answer about hair: ""My hair is not dyed. It's gray. But very little.""

Simple. But it shows he's not vain, doesn't lie about small things, is comfortable being exactly who he is.

8. He Knows When To Push And When To Let Go
When Arshad gets uncomfortable talking about which films he regrets: ""Tell me more about that.""

When Arshad says he doesn't remember much about his process: Samdish doesn't push. Just moves on. Respects the boundary.

When Arshad mentions his parents dying: Samdish doesn't make it the center of the conversation. Lets Arshad decide how much to share. No exploitation.

That's judgment. That's skill. That's respect.

9. He Treats Every Guest The Same
Watch the Tejashwi interview. Watch the Arshad interview. Same approach:

Do your homework
Ask interesting questions
Shut up and listen
Create space for truth
Don't perform
Let the guest be the star
It doesn't matter if you're interviewing a politician or an actor. The approach is the same. The respect is the same.

That's consistency. That's integrity.

10. He Walks Away When It Matters
Birhor Tola. Other media crews already there. Realizes he's part of a circus. Stops filming. Tells his audience exactly why.

That's journalism. That's ethics. That's knowing when your presence extracts rather than illuminates.

Most interviewers would keep filming. Get the content. Build the brand.

Samdish walked away.

What Makes Him The Best In The World
Not Just India. The World.
Compare to Western interviewers:

Joe Rogan: 3-hour conversations but often makes it about himself, interrupts, needs to show he's smart
Howard Stern: Pushes buttons but performs shock, makes himself part of the story
Anderson Cooper: Professional but too safe, never really lets guests reveal themselves
Graham Norton: Entertaining but surface-level, celebrity showcase not human revelation
Terry Gross: Excellent preparation but sometimes too intellectual, not enough silence
Samdish does what none of them do:

Three hours of genuine conversation - not interview, conversation
Complete absence of ego - never makes it about himself
Questions that reveal character - not just stories
Silence that creates space - doesn't fear the pause
Preparation that enables improvisation - knows everything, shows nothing
Boundaries respected - pushes where it matters, retreats when needed
Humor without performance - natural, not forced
Ethics over content - walks away from the circus
The Evidence
Arshad Warsi - 3 hours 14 minutes:

You learn about:

His entire relationship with work and money
His fears about death and responsibility
His marriage and how it's changed
His parenting philosophy
His creative process
His insecurities
His understanding of acting
His views on religion, social media, parenting, relationships
What makes him laugh, what scares him, what he loves, what he regrets
All of it honest. None of it PR. All of it revealing.

Tejashwi Yadav - 50+ minutes:

You learn about:

Real internal party disagreements
His actual relationship with his father
His honest take on Nitish Kumar's betrayals
What he thinks about corruption (direct acknowledgment, no deflection)
His kids, his marriage, his daily life
Whether he's actually ready to lead
All of it honest. Political but human. Strategic but real.

The Difference
Other interviewers create content.

Samdish creates understanding.

Other interviewers want viral moments. Samdish wants truth.

Other interviewers interrupt with their own cleverness. Samdish waits for the guest's wisdom.

Other interviewers perform journalism. Samdish is a journalist.

Why This Matters
In a world of:

10-minute interviews cut into 60-second clips
Softball questions designed to make guests comfortable
Interviewers who want to be stars
Performance journalism where nothing real happens
Content creation that serves algorithms not understanding
Samdish does the opposite.

Three-hour conversations. Hard questions asked gently. Guests as stars. Real journalism where truth emerges. Content that serves understanding not virality.

The Verdict
Best interviewer in India? Obviously.

Best interviewer in the world? Yes.

Because he does what no one else does: creates space for human beings to reveal themselves fully, honestly, without performance, without exploitation, with respect and curiosity and patience.

That's not just good interviewing.

That's art.

If you want to learn how to talk to human beings, watch Samdish.

If you want to see what journalism can be, watch Samdish.

If you want to understand what ""unfiltered"" actually means, watch Samdish.

Everything else is just content.

This is conversation.

This is truth.

This is the best.",0,2025-10-25T04:25:28Z

What if both muslim and hindu lives in the Kashmir valley together. No violence. 
Hindu share their love with them. And Muslims share their love with them. No genocide.
Muslims participate in Hindu ceremonies and Hindu participate in theirs. No more killing.

as a bihari myself, i appreciate the time and work that you put into this
coming from the privileged side of bihar, stories like these never came to us and we believed what we saw around us, indeed the state needs a lot to be done.
just a small suggestion, put up fundraisers for wherever you go so people that have been blessed can give their dues to the state, moreover to those of the nation, that never see the same light as we do.

j6wDNhobSIU,@PradeepPrasad-r3e,"चुनाव नहीं, लोकतंत्र का पर्व
भारतीय लोकतंत्र में चुनाव केवल सत्ता परिवर्तन का माध्यम नहीं, बल्कि एक ऐसा अवसर बन जाता है जिसे कई लोग एक बड़े पर्व की तरह देखते हैं। चुनावी मौसम आते ही गलियों, सड़कों और चौराहों पर एक अलग ही चहल-पहल दिखाई देने लगती है। इस समय कुछ गरीबों के लिए भी जीवन में थोड़ी राहत आ जाती है।

चुनावों का पहला फायदा यह दिखता है कि कई झुग्गियों की टूटी-फूटी छतें दलों के पोस्टरों से ढक जाती हैं, जिससे बरसात से बचने का जुगाड़ हो जाता है। पोस्टर लगाने वाले, पेम्फलेट बांटने वाले और रैलियों में भीड़ जुटाने वाले लोगों को कुछ दिनों का रोज़गार मिल जाता है। बेरोज़गार युवाओं को लगता है कि लेबर चौक से बेहतर भुगतान तो इन्हीं दिनों मिलता है, और काम भी ऐसा जिसमें मेहनत कम—बस नारे लगाने हैं और नेता के साथ भीड़ बनानी है।

चुनाव के दिनों में नेताओं की उदारता भी देखने लायक होती है। रैलियों में खाने-पीने की मुफ्त व्यवस्था, पानी से लेकर भोजन तक की सुविधा—सब कुछ उपलब्ध होता है। यही कारण है कि कुछ गरीब और बेरोज़गार लोग मज़ाक-मज़ाक में कहते हैं कि काश यह चुनावी पर्व पूरे साल चलता रहे।

सबसे रोचक बात यह है कि वे नेता, जिनके दर्शन चार साल दस महीने तक मुश्किल से होते हैं, वे भी इस अवधि में बड़ी आस्था और उत्साह के साथ जनता के बीच घूमते नज़र आते हैं। मानो वे जनता के सबसे निकट और सबसे हितैषी हों।

दरअसल, चुनाव भारतीय लोकतंत्र की आत्मा हैं। परंतु इनके आस-पास जो सामाजिक-आर्थिक चित्र उभरता है, वह कभी-कभी हास्यास्पद भी लगता है और सोचने पर मजबूर भी करता है। जहां एक ओर लोकतंत्र का यह पर्व जनता को अपनी शक्ति का एहसास कराता है, वहीं दूसरी ओर यह गरीबों की मजबूरियों और नेताओं की मौसमी संवेदनशीलता को भी उजागर करता है।

चुनाव सच में लोकतंत्र का पर्व हैं—लेकिन यह पर्व तभी सार्थक होगा जब इसके लाभ केवल कुछ दिनों तक नहीं, बल्कि पूरे साल जनता तक पहुँचें।

cgnAKOkd4f8,@ArchitaMaurya-f4r,"Tbh I hate this guy because I've seen Uttar Pradesh when he was CM and now I'm seeing Uttar Pradesh. Clearly the difference is visible. I can choose any party but never Samajvadi Party. 

When he was CM here that hooligans used to stop girls' school buses at mid way and give threats to put buses to fire if anyone opposes the wrong doings and harassment of school girls.

I personally have faced it 4 times back then when i was in school.

1. I cannot forget the day when during my school days we were coming back and our bus was stopped by some boys between the age of 12 years to 16 years moslty with some rods just by the fact that my bus driver declined them to take into bus because only girls were there in the bus and guess where IN FRONT OF THAT TIME MLA OF THAT AREA ( BELONG FROM SAMAJWADI PARTY). They beaten him and snatched his mobile phone. We were so scared that our driver left everything to them and just saved us and escaped. The security guard of MLA house was there only and he himsef was smiling during that beatings and someone was there inside walking in the garden, he was not bothered even. 

No police case nothing, even that driver was warned not to go that side, some other school auto will go there separately.

2. One girl was there she belongs to the muslim community, one day she didn't get the seat to sit in the bus and was crying, however there was 15 people who were standing in bus because of some issue that some auto has any mechanical issue so school made the students of that auto to go by bus for a singal day. When we reached her house she ran straight to her home while crying and  just a minute after her brother came may be around 28 to 30 year he abused bus driver and warned him to not cross the village , if that bus crossed it he will burn the entire bus and after he took a rod and smashed the last window of bus. 

No police case ! 

3. The group of a 5 people were following the bus since a week and whistling and flying kisses to school girls in bus. One day my driver took a best move we're almost the half way when they were trying to overtake, the driver back the bus and straight park the bus to the police station full of school girls then a jeap full of police officers with the guns was sent for the safety then all the girls were drooped home safely. 

4. Safety was a joke that one day a school function was there and as the school captain and house captains we 4 girls had to stay till 5 pm after that our teacher 2 Sirs and a ma'am had to come to drop us personally to our home almost 12 km from school.

These are the majors but there are many more cases in front of my eyses only. 

I'll die but not vote SAMAJVADI PARTY ever. People who vote him are the people who used to do all the wrong doings that time and now they're not able to do all these things so there are dying. 

May Mahadev give him the death no one wants and struggle all the life.",0,2025-11-05T06:53:48Z

nKrbwh9_LQE,@Syeedasgar,"Solution if govt want to give them happy life,,

the population there is approximately 20,000, with around 5,000 households. Each household currently pays ₹100 per water tanker, three times a month, which means a total monthly cost of:
₹3,600 per household
Total monthly expenditure = ₹3,600 × 5,000 = ₹1.8 crore
If a pipeline is constructed, the government can charge a minimal ₹100 per month per household, making the total monthly revenue:
₹100 × 5,000 = ₹5 lakh per month
Yearly revenue = ₹5 lakh × 12 = ₹60 lakh
Considering the estimated pipeline cost, the government can recover its investment within 3-4 years, while also saving fuel costs spent on transporting water via tankers.
If a government with a true sense of humanity takes the initiative, this issue could be resolved in just 1-2 years, ensuring a long-term solution for the people. This is how India can progress toward becoming a developed nation—by prioritizing efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable infrastructure rather than temporary fixes.",1,2025-03-10T15:24:24Z

nKrbwh9_LQE,@ashutoshjamwal27,"I honestly feel so privileged after watching this video. But to me, realistically, that will be the impact of such videos unless we as citizens decide to hold the government responsible and accountable for all this. And by citizens, its the middle class - predominantly the upper middle class. That's where the pressure will hurt the politicians the most. Until then, the lowest economic classes of citizens are doomed to live in such conditions, because the government does not care, no matter who wins. 

For me, the main solution is a complete overhaul of the government structure - giving more power to the decentralized structure. So all the responsibility boils down to local leaders. This will make their budgets bigger and their jobs more accountable to the public. I am no expert in policy, but to me somehow we need to empower the local government structure in terms of their budgets, responsibility and accountability.",0,2025-01-26T12:10:41Z

I know i am one of those person who often believes and always says , sb chees sarkar nai krti which is right at times , but addressing such issues it's sole responsibilities government , government should take the initiatives and other will follow or necessary changes would be done , I now comment krne se bhi koi solution nai milega, but its high time people of should start voting for their self , they future they aspire, they should vote above caste , creed , sex. 

And most important topic we should demand government to address - all those people who are eligible for voting  and by any circumstances they living out of their voting place they can vote online or by any medium which is secured enough which can't be hindered or manipulated.

LhEXULtizEI,@ayushsinha1813,"51:02 I actually have a different view. I think that most of the sucking up to authority behaviour that we learn in this country is what we learn in school. A few students who maybe good in academics, sometimes sports and other extracurricular activities become monitors and head students and carry out the wishes of the school administration in exchange for a reputation, maybe more help in exams and such even and the vast majority of students end up on fringes; all of it in the name of discipline. Now compare that to the Indian state; the relationship between government and civil service. Same sucking up to power, perks, privileges and a general culture (not all) of entitlement and othering of people. And the Indian system of today is mainly the remnants of the British system, both in education and governance. So, I don't think that the government needs to set an example from the top; no good constitution relies primarily on the whims of the people in power. It has to be a bottom up work to have the kind of governance that actually involves people. I feel that it starts at the local level where it is the weakest. The 73rd and 74th amendment are not enough and they haven't been implemented well enough. And in case of education; there is an awful lot that needs to be envisioned before even attempting something. One of the counters to the behaviour described above would be to have students learn to act together, in solidarity for good causes; the ability to think through and get to a reasonable definition of good causes, methods, activities rather than making them more docile and just teaching them to cope with a messed up world where they learn law of the jungle.",2,2026-01-09T17:13:28Z

ये बात कोई भी विपक्षी दल या कांग्रेस मुस्लिम लीग नहीं बोलती है। और अगर एक आद बार बोल भी दिया हो तो उस पर कोई कार्यवाही नहीं करते क्यों कि कांग्रेस मुस्लिम लीग + इंडी गैंग मुस्लिम को अनपढ़ रखना चाहते हैं । पढ़ लिखने से सही गलत का विवेक मुस्लिम जनता में जागृत हो सकता है  और उस से कांग्रेस मुस्लिम लीग + इंडी गैंग का इस्लामिक कट्टरवाद के सहारे पनपा हुआ मुस्लिम वोट बैंक खतरे में आता है । 
इसी लिए मुस्लिम समाज जान ले कि कांग्रेस मुस्लिम लीग + विपक्षी दल ही मुस्लिम समाज के विरोधी बने हुए हैं पिछले 75 साल से और मुस्लिम समाज को उठाने और तरक्की के रास्ते पर लाने का प्रयास जान बूझ कर कभी नहीं करते। 
इसका रिजल्ट ये है कि मुस्लिम समाज देश में ज्यादातर निम्न स्तर वाले काम करते हैं जिसमें पढ़ाई नहीं होती। 
और इसी लिए इस्लामिक कट्टरवाद को बढ़ाने के लिए मदरसों का दुरुपयोग होता  है । 

एक गलत विचारधारा जिसके कारण मुस्लिम आज भी इस देश में अनपढ़ रह गए , इस पर कांग्रेस मुस्लिम लीग + इंडी गैंग चुप रहती है।

कांग्रेस+ इंडी गैंग अपने स्वार्थ के कारण 20 करोड़ मुस्लिम समाज के भविष्य से खिलवाड़ कर रहा है और वो भी निरंतर। 

सिर्फ बीजेपी मुस्लिम के उत्थान के लिए सोचती है और करती भी है जैसे तीन तलाक कानून। 

मुस्लिम को बीजेपी को वोट देना चाहिए अपने बच्चों के उज्जवल भविष्य के लिए। 

सिर्फ बीजेपी मुस्लिम के उत्थान के लिए सोचती है और करती भी है जैसे तीन तलाक कानून।

LgYUWcqPwJg,@akshayitti1044,"56:33 What does she means about ""As a nation we didn't have a religious identity before""? And also she said not organically? "" Why you don't know who you are""? Maybe she is right but, I think she don't know and how's it possible? And I'm talking about religious matters here and how could she says as a nation we didn't have religious identity? The robbers, dacaits, missionaries and Britishers who came to this nation to achieve their agenda and propoganda are mentioned this nation as ""HINDUSTAN"" only because they addressed the peoples identity as Hindu who worshiped the "" Sanatan Dharma"" in the name of Hindus. So, it's was our identity and it is.

Reason for my above statement was because of her statement which conveys 2 meanings. No offense but I thought to give opinion having my opinion and fact.

So unless you are making movies for america, I don't think this will be able to earn you a lot and you're anyways end up making less of such movies yourself coz as you said ""I love money"" but on the contrary, you wanna show people feminist movies.

People should watch Documentaries not just to support but to make self aware whats happening around also If people start buying tickets it can be also screened on theaters and there will boost to Independent Docu scene.There are lot stories to be told in the world but a proper economic steam the Independent Docu scene will get change!,0,2024-06-28T09:05:05Z

They're a mature law abiding society as patriotic as any. They are perfectly capable of governing state affairs and those powers should be returned to the people. They don't object to Army and Security forces. They're neither an internal or external security threat and would make a great example of how states integrate with the country. While grazing lands might be a concern now but they won't be because even people there would like to urbanize. There won't be goat herders like there aren't many ""bail gadi chalaks"" or ox cart drivers anymore. We need to be patient, like there isn't enough land down south we can't commercialize right now. The beauty of Ladakh is that it has been mostly untouched by modern man and we should keep it that way.  If you want to make it productive then offer quality tourism which pays to keep it clean and enact laws which prohibit the misuse of natural resources. That way the Ladakhi people will also get to enjoy the fruits of development which comes with integrating with the economy and polity of India.",1,2024-06-16T11:52:57Z

Si-n78Jzfro,@graffitiverse9567,Basically a false promise was necessary to win the support of the people of Ladak. So that they in turn can support the decision of removing the Article 35A and 370. But little did they know that they were being  bated by the Central Government for something they couldn't comprehend and now they are paying the price for betraying their Brothers.,2,2024-05-04T16:16:10Z

Si-n78Jzfro,@raistantray244,"""I don’t know who in your team looks after the comment sections of your videos, but I hope this comment reaches you as it might be important. You're aware that individuals outside the governmental system can often offer ideas or suggestions that are more innovative or flexible than those within the government. You yourself exemplify this idea; you've proposed ideas to Punjab CM and Supriya Sule about Nitin Gadkari, which they found interesting. This ability stems from being at the grassroots level of the country, enabling you to understand problems deeply. However, one aspect related to your career is worth considering: it would be beneficial for you to broaden the scope of your interviews. One important step would be to engage with local journalists in the area, district, or state before conducting interviews with leaders from that region. This approach would allow you to gain insights from the grassroots level and provide a broader reality check or perspective for your questioning methods when interviewing leaders. (I am posting this comment to various videos so that it will reach you)""",2,2024-05-02T07:50:00Z

यहां एक संक्षिप्त, प्रभावशाली और भावनात्मक हिन्दी ड्राफ्ट तैयार किया गया है जिसे प्रशांत किशोर अपने भाषण या साक्षात्कार में इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं। इसमें *रिचर्ड बाख* की किताब **Illusions** की “leap of faith” (विश्वास की छलांग) की अवधारणा को बिहार की मौजूदा स्थिति और *जन सुराज आंदोलन* के संदर्भ में जोड़ा गया है

""रिचर्ड बाख की किताब *Illusions* में एक कहानी है — सागर की गहराई में रहने वाला एक छोटा जीव, जो रोज़ एक ही तरीके से तैरता रहता था। उसके आस-पास सब कह रहे थे — ‘जैसा सदीयों से चल रहा है, वैसा ही चलने दो।’ लेकिन एक दिन उस जीव ने सोचा — ‘अगर ऊपर उठ कर देखूं तो शायद सागर की रौशनी कुछ और हो।’ उसने अपनी जान पर खेल के सागर की सतह की ओर छलांग लगाई — **विश्वास की छलांग (Vishwas ki Chhalang)**। और जैसे ही वो सतह पर पहुंचा, पहली बार उसने सूरज की रोशनी देखी।""

""आज बिहार भी उसी मोड़ पर खड़ा है। बरसों से वही गलियाँ, वही नेता, वही वादे। सब कह रहे हैं — ‘बदलाव नहीं हो सकता।’ लेकिन जन सुराज यही कह रहा है — अगर हम सब एक बार **विश्वास की छलांग** लगाएँ, तो बिहार भी उस उजाले को देख सकता है जो आज तक सागर की गहराई में छिपा है।""

""हमने न सत्ता से डर कर शुरू किया, न हार-जीत की गिनती के लिए। हमने भरोसा किया कि बिहार के लोग अपने भाग्य के खुद माली बन सकते हैं। जैसे कहावत है — ‘जिहनवा उठ गइल, ओके कौन रोकी?’ अगर जनता ठान ले, तो कोई ताकत उसे पीछे नहीं खींच सकती।""

""तो भाइयों और बहनों, अब डरने का नहीं, छलांग लगाने का समय है — *विश्वास की छलांग*। क्योंकि बदलाव वही करता है जो अंधेरे को किस्मत नहीं मानता, बल्कि रौशनी खोजने निकल पड़ता है।""

***

यह संस्करण भावनात्मक रूप से गहरा है, ग्रामीण और शहरी दोनों वर्गों को जोड़ सकता है, और “leap of faith” को “विश्वास की छलांग” या “आस्था के छलाँग” की तरह लोकभाषा में उतारता है जो भाषण में बहुत प्रभावी लग सकता है",2,2025-10-18T09:39:36Z

आज देश के ज़्यादातर नेताओं को देखिए, बोलते तो हैं, लेकिन बिना आधार के। तथ्यहीन बातें, खोखले वादे और दिशाहीन बयानबाज़ी ही ज़्यादातर सुनने को मिलती है।

लेकिन जब मैं इस व्यक्ति को सुनता हूँ, तो लगता है कि राजनीति ऐसे ही होनी चाहिए। यहाँ बातें होती हैं डेटा, तथ्य, भविष्य की रूपरेखा (road map), आने वाली पीढ़ियों, विकास, पलायन जैसे असली मुद्दों पर। और वह भी ठोस आधार और स्पष्ट दृष्टिकोण के साथ।

मैं बिहार से नहीं हूँ, लेकिन फिर भी बड़ी उत्सुकता से देखूँगा कि इस बार बिहार चुनाव का परिणाम क्या आता है। अगर बिहार की जनता प्रशांत किशोर जैसे नेता को अवसर नहीं देती, तो मुझे और मेरे जैसे तमाम थोड़े बहुत पढ़े-लिखे लोगों को यही लगेगा कि शायद बिहार का भविष्य कभी नहीं बदल सकता।

मैं व्यक्तिगत रूप से चाहता हूँ कि ऐसे नेताओं को इस देश की राजनीतिक व्यवस्था में जगह मिले, क्योंकि देश और समाज को वास्तविक बदलाव और नई सोच की ज़रूरत है।",1,2025-10-03T19:26:08Z

fPP_3XCXbPQ,@creativestudypoint2.045,"बिहार के प्रिय भाइयों और बहनों,

हमारे राज्य के इतिहास के इस महत्वपूर्ण क्षण में, मैं विनम्रतापूर्वक आपका समय और ध्यान चाहता हूँ। बिहार अद्वितीय विरासत, ज्ञान और साहस की भूमि है। सदियों से, हमारी धरती ने महान नेताओं, विचारकों और सुधारकों को जन्म दिया है जिन्होंने न केवल हमारे राज्य, बल्कि हमारे राष्ट्र के भाग्य को भी आकार दिया है। फिर भी, इस गौरवशाली अतीत के बावजूद, बिहार की वर्तमान वास्तविकता हम सभी के लिए गहरी चिंता का विषय है। जब बिहार की कहानी इतिहास में लिखी जाएगी, तो क्या हम चाहते हैं कि इसे केवल गरीबी, पिछड़ेपन और खोए हुए अवसरों की भूमि के रूप में याद किया जाए? या हम चाहते हैं कि बिहार को प्रगति, गौरव और समृद्धि के राज्य के रूप में पहचाना जाए? इसका उत्तर आज हमारे द्वारा लिए गए विकल्पों में निहित है।

ऐसा ही एक विकल्प अब हमारे सामने है, और वह विकल्प है प्रशांत किशोर और जन सुराज आंदोलन।

प्रशांत किशोर केवल एक और राजनीतिक नाम नहीं हैं। वे एक ऐसे व्यक्ति हैं जिन्होंने लोगों की समस्याओं को समझने और तर्क, योजना और वास्तविकता पर आधारित समाधान खोजने के लिए खुद को समर्पित कर दिया है।  मैंने व्यक्तिगत रूप से उनके 50-100 भाषण और संवाद देखे हैं, और मैंने उनमें खोखले वादे नहीं, बल्कि बदलाव लाने का स्पष्ट आत्मविश्वास, दृढ़ संकल्प और इच्छाशक्ति देखी है। उनके पास बिहार के विकास का एक रोडमैप है, और कई पारंपरिक नेताओं के विपरीत, उनका दृष्टिकोण व्यावहारिक, आधुनिक और आम नागरिकों के संघर्षों से गहराई से जुड़ा हुआ है।

बिहार आज बेरोजगारी, पलायन, कमजोर बुनियादी ढांचे, खराब स्वास्थ्य सेवा और हमारे युवाओं के लिए अवसरों की कमी जैसी चुनौतियों का सामना कर रहा है। बिहारी परिवारों की कई पीढ़ियाँ बुनियादी आजीविका और सम्मान की तलाश में अपनी मातृभूमि छोड़ने को मजबूर हुई हैं। लाचारी का यह चक्र अवश्य समाप्त होना चाहिए, और यह तभी समाप्त होगा जब हम जाति, धर्म और पुराने राजनीतिक दांव-पेंचों से ऊपर उठकर एक ऐसे नेता को चुनेंगे जो प्रगति और सशक्तिकरण की भाषा बोलता हो।

प्रशांत किशोर उस सकारात्मक बदलाव का प्रतिनिधित्व करते हैं। वे युवा, ऊर्जावान हैं, और सबसे महत्वपूर्ण बात, वे शासन में जनभागीदारी में विश्वास करते हैं। उनका दृष्टिकोण बिहार पर शासन करने के बारे में नहीं है; यह बिहार के लोगों के साथ मिलकर बिहार का निर्माण करने के बारे में है। जन सुराज केवल एक राजनीतिक अभियान नहीं है - यह आत्मसम्मान, न्याय और विकास का आंदोलन है।

 प्रिय बिहारी भाइयों और बहनों, इस वर्ष, आपके पास हमारे भविष्य की दिशा तय करने की शक्ति है। यह एक चुनाव की बात नहीं है—यह बिहार के इतिहास को फिर से लिखने की बात है। अगर हम आज कदम नहीं उठाएँगे, तो बिहार भारत के सबसे गरीब और सबसे उपेक्षित राज्यों में से एक के रूप में दर्ज होता रहेगा। लेकिन अगर हम समझदारी से काम लें, और एकजुट होकर प्रशांत किशोर को वोट दें, तो बिहार नई ऊर्जा और नई उम्मीद के साथ फिर से उभरेगा।

याद रखें: कोई बाहरी ताकत हमें बचाने नहीं आएगी। बिहार का बदलाव भीतर से शुरू होना चाहिए, और इसकी शुरुआत हमसे होनी चाहिए—इस धरती के गौरवशाली बेटे-बेटियों से। झूठे वादों और विभाजनकारी राजनीति में अपना वोट बर्बाद न होने दें। अपना वोट केवल उस भविष्य के लिए दें जो आप अपने बच्चों को विरासत में देना चाहते हैं। विकास, सम्मान और बिहार के गौरव के लिए अपना वोट दें।

प्रशांत किशोर को वोट दें। जन सुराज के लिए वोट दें। बिहार के भविष्य के लिए वोट दें।

आइए, हम सब मिलकर यह सुनिश्चित करें कि जब बिहार का इतिहास फिर से लिखा जाए, तो वह प्रगति, समृद्धि और जनशक्ति की कहानी के रूप में लिखा जाए।

 गहरे सम्मान और आशा के साथ,
बिहार के एक शुभचिंतक",3,2025-09-25T16:33:25Z

I belong to a farmer family and I have seen that no development is done in any village even like basic roads, drainage, providing some funds for their shops. Nothing at all I have seen this from last five years living in a village here in Punjab. The upper class support the upscale societies. That is all.
The farmers just as you see in today's flood scenario are living that simple. Just check their houses. Not even enough funds to build proper houses. And here we have our lovely ministers using all the funds to their own conveniences. It's a shame to have such politics no wonder punjabi is self sufficient. They never look at any one to provide and relief. The gurudwaras are  known to provide food and shelter and that's the best they have followed from the gurus teachings. 
The farmer feeds all households and this is what its paid back with.
During corona I spoke to a Himachali and he was thanking me saying its because of Punjab we survive. All food was provided through Punjab to Himachal like grains and pulses.",1,2025-09-05T15:05:48Z

z4ZQcUjRTGM,@Stewie-ed1ct,"Really beautiful post w 0:00 orth sharing with others because it had shown the true problems n feelings of the Anndatas of the country who r forced to adopt a tough attitude towards the both state n central governments. As learnt from the post kisans who r both religious n illiterate easily fall into the traps of political leaders. Government is trying to force them to go as per the instructions of the Corporates n sell their produce to the Corporates who will store them in their warehouses n sell at a high rates to the people.This will put the common man of the country into problems.So government should have accepted the demands of the Kisans like MSP, waive of loans n cheap accessories n  items like fertilizer, insecticide,urea etc to them.Government should also follow n apply the various findings of the reports it had constituted in the past.Why the government is putting a deaf ears to all these reports is nobody guess but it appears to be a tactic to delay the matter that should have been settled on top -priority after consultation with kisan union leaders instead of showing their poweror use of force. Kisans should also educate their children n youths so that they can receive higher qualification which is the need of the day. If   the Sikhs can  achieve high posts in foreign countries like America  Canada France Britain etc with their efforts why they branded as separatists, terroristsor traitors ii the country after 75 years or so. Contribution of Sikh Gurus and warriors had already had  been recorded in the history of the Indian will b remembered for centuries to come. Indian border is safe only because it is guarded by the people from Punjab. In the past also our forefathers died facing invaders like Abdali, Nader Shah , Mohammad Gauri, Alexander etc n given them a tasty lessons all because Tenth  Guru had made the poor, helpless, untouchable or those belonging to lower castes as martial n empowered them to take up arms against injustice, supression or freedom of speech n religion . History is full of their contribution to the freedom movement which is not known to many of our children n youths who are discarding Sikhi n drifting towards Western customs n culture. There is no unity in the Panth n our leaders both religious and political r puppets in the hands of the government in power.",1,2025-02-04T10:11:29Z

z4ZQcUjRTGM,@vitrickmartinez7115,Farmers bill was tabled to help and support farmers and provide insurance on their crops but they opposed it at the time without knowing what it contained. A guy in the video said we will do what our leader tell us to do meaning they literally have no idea what they are fighting they simply mean to oppose the government..i just have one question how many of them has actually read farmers bill...it literally provided farmers with a fixed MSP which could have made our farmers income stable and prevented the thousands of them from suicide which they commit due to companies not providing a fixed price. Many of you may think their protest was the right thing but Punjab isn't the only state where there are farmers.. there are lakhs and lakhs of farmers across the country so congratulations guys by making sure government repeal the farmer's bill you guys have unintentionally encouraged the thousands of farmer's suicide which they will persue due to not having a stable source of income.,5,2024-09-11T04:41:41Z

Mazza ayega … it is a crazy socio-economical cluster fudge!

Appeasing rude and rudimentary rickshaw wala vs IT employer paying lakhs per month in taxes!

Truth to be told, the local MLAs goes to big apartments for votes cuz everyone has Bangalore voter ID & Aadhaar address change has happened and the MLAs do not go to the village aka ‘halli’

3000 votes from an apartment complex vs the village of 200 where the apartment complex is built! Where will the village grown local politician will go to ask vote! 

Super GAP!


Banao video series! Mazza aa jayega! Conflict views trending sab ho jayega!

But m agenda is that a citizen of India should feel safe everywhere in India …. 

Do this Samdish… 🙌🏼

EKg5Hrkt9Gw,@raistantray244,"""I don’t know who in your team looks after the comment sections of your videos, but I hope this comment reaches you as it might be important. You're aware that individuals outside the governmental system can often offer ideas or suggestions that are more innovative or flexible than those within the government. You yourself exemplify this idea; you've proposed ideas to Punjab CM and Supriya Sule about Nitin Gadkari, which they found interesting. This ability stems from being at the grassroots level of the country, enabling you to understand problems deeply. However, one aspect related to your career is worth considering: it would be beneficial for you to broaden the scope of your interviews. One important step would be to engage with local journalists in the area, district, or state before conducting interviews with leaders from that region. This approach would allow you to gain insights from the grassroots level and provide a broader reality check or perspective for your questioning methods when interviewing leaders.

I’m from the Northeast, and growing up, i noticed that we often gather together for community clean-up drives and these practice taught us to rely less on the system and more on ourselves. While the government’s role is to make life easier, widespread corruption has made that difficult. So, if we as individuals takes action on our own, maintain our streets and neighbourhoods, it could be a meaningful step towards a cleaner and better environment because true change can only come from within, from ourselves…",0,2025-10-22T21:41:26Z

h0-m-zWv53A,@Deepak0001prajapati,"Ek aurat bahut zor-shor se netaon ko bhal bura bol rahi thi, uska kehna hai ki:
""Har baar election se pehle bade-bade vaade hote hain. Par sach yeh hai hi nahi jo usne kaha. Sach to kuch aur hai jo aage video me apko pata chal hi ajega. Kyuki Yeh bahut sharm ki baat hai ki election waadon se nahi, balki paise se jeetey jaate hain—specifically, Rs. 2000 per vote ke liye. Isse har koi ‘bikau’ ho jata hai. Aur ye neta logon ko Rs. 2000 mein kharid lete hai, aur ab yeh jo chahein, wo karenge. In logon ko sawal poochne ka koi haq nahi hai, kyunki inhone khud ko kuch paise ke liye khud bech diya hai.

uss video me ek family ke baare mein bhi baat ho rahi thi, jisme ek bachhe ke papa ko police ne pakad liya tha. Usne kaha:
""uske parivar mein 6 bhai aur 6 behnein hain. ab sawal sabse bada ye hai ki ""Murgi bhi itne ande nahi deti jitne iss aadmi ne bachhe paida kar liye"". Ab yeh log 25 gaj ke ghar mein 12 bachhon ke saath rah rahe hain. Aap kaise ummid kar rahe ho ki sarkar in ando ke liye chat ka intezam kare aur ghar banwaye? Nahi, yeh possible nahi hai. Yeh baat nahi hai ki sarkar galat hai ya sahi, lekin sawaal poochne ka haq na aapka hai, na in bikau logo ka. Aaj bhi AAP aur BJP Rs. 2000 per vote bech rahe hain. Agar aap YouTube par yeh dekhaenge, toh aapko samajh mein aayega ki kya chal raha hai.""",0,2025-02-04T17:36:48Z

This isn't safe because residential elevators, which are meant for families and children, could expose kids to strangers within the society. You need to grasp this logic. I hope you'll feel the same way as your kids grow up. Additionally, dogs should also be taken in separate elevators, it's safer for everyone, including kids and adults, since dogs can behave unpredictably around strangers.",0,2024-09-19T18:19:19Z

ykQAnCErcFw,@wisdom6666,"When I was in 11th and 12th, I was preparing for NEET. I cleared NEET in 2017 and got admission to GMC Srinagar. But behind that achievement, there’s a story of struggle. Our total family income was just ₹8,000 a month. My parents were divorced, and I lived with my grandparents. Whenever I wanted to buy a book, I had to start saving one or two months in advance.

People often say education is expensive — but I’ve learned that education isn’t really expensive; some people just make it look expensive to hide their lack of interest. I studied with a low income, yet I cleared NEET. Today, I earn enough to support my family and my kids.

When a poor man decides to educate his children, he can do anything. He’ll extract his blood from his veins and turn it into ink if that’s what it takes to write his children’s future. Because when a boy or girl truly has passion for learning — whether they’re brilliant or not — if they try, and try, and give their hundred percent, education will always give something back. And what it gives back will always be more than what you had before.

In our state, a laborer earns around ₹700 a day — about ₹21,000 a month — which is more than what we had. Still, I managed. That’s why I say: education is not that expensive. Yes, it can be expensive, but not as much as people think. You can pay ₹2–3 lakhs for a coaching center, or you can learn online, from YouTube, or from a local teacher charging ₹2,000 a month. Guidance is everywhere now — it’s your dedication that matters.

To any student reading this — NEET, UPSC, JEE, CLAT, NET — remember: I’ve seen people from every background succeed. Some of my friends are toppers, some are officers, some cracked big exams — not all were rich, but all were determined.

Education is not expensive. Effort is priceless.",0,2025-11-12T14:45:44Z

मैं समस्त गद्दी वर्ग की तरफ से आपका बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद करता हूं जो आपने हमारे इन गद्दी भाइयों के साथ कुछ पल व्यतीत किए । आशा है कि इन गद्दी बंधुओ के साथ साथ आपने भी थोडा बहुत मनोरंजन किया होगा और हम गद्दी लोगों के बारे में जानने की कोशिश की । यह देखकर बहुत अच्छा लगा ।  गद्दी जनजीवन बहुत उतार चढ़ाव से भरा है जिसे आपने एक शाम में ही महसूस कर लिया होगा । रहने के लिए अच्छा बिस्तर नहीं  कई बार जंगली जानवरों से सामना ....
वावजूद इसके बडे शहरों की पतली गलियों और प्रदूषित वायु की तुलना यहां यह सब सामान्य है और प्रकृति के हसीन नजारे भी है ।
हम गद्दी लोगों की एक अपनी बोली है ( जो आपने इन बंधुओ के शब्दों में सुने होंगें जो हिंदी से मेल नहीं खा रहे ) अलग रहन-सहन ,खान-पान , संस्कृति , संगीत  अलग वेशभूषा (चोली - पुरुषों की और दोड़ी महिलाओं की ) जो कोट इन्होंनें पहन रखा है यह भी स्वनिर्मित भेड की ऊन का है और भी बहुत कुछ .... 
आशा है आप भविष्य में फिर कभी हमारे हिमाचल ,भरमौर जिला चंबा में शिरकत करेंगे और गद्दी जनजीवन को लोगों के समक्ष पेश कर पर्यटन की दृष्टि से भी दिखाएगें और यहां की स्वनिर्मित वस्तुओं को जानेंगे ।
हार्दिक आभार ❤

ZOrNiT-OPNc,@pallethalli3835,"Comrade Sitaram Yechury is a great genius 
A great theorist 
Can talk about all things amazingly. All political parties can attract intellectuals 
....
But Comrade Yechury was unable to attract his family towards the Communist Party 
It is very sad that he could not make his sons, his wives or any of his other family members even simple sympathizers towards his politics. 
Even the general strengthening of the Communist Party could not be achieved through his brilliant intellect 
Moreover, during Yechury's tenure as the National General Secretary, the Communist Party CPM became very weak across the country. It has lost its status as a national party and is currently only a state party. The erstwhile states of Tripura and West Bengal are now without a party name. 
Has the Communist Party anywhere in the country been strengthened by Yechuri's intelligence...?
Yechury did not possess all the qualities that the best Communist Party leaders should possess. 
Yechury smokes 20 packs of cigarettes a day. He also consumes some alcohol. The investment of the predatory ruling classes is the friend that all the underclasses need. He talks to all of them very friendly and charming. Yechury garu magically attracts the leaders of all the predatory political parties and investors in the country. 
But he could not attract the poor towards the Communist Party through his intelligence. He could not attract the working class people at all. Tripura could not keep the people of Bengal under the communist party. He could not produce any activists anywhere in his own Telugu states. 
The CPM party has given all its power to Yechury. Recognized at national and international level. But what did Yechury give to the CPM party? It did not attract working class people. CPM has not strengthened the party. Even the death of his family did not make him communists. Under the leadership of any Churu, the youth in the country have not been made communists. 
Ae Churi remains only a politician like ordinary politicians in the country. 
Yechury's life as a real proletariat politician is not so idealistic as the Communists should be proud of...not attractive. 
like this

But as someone still learning Indian sociology, I feel there’s a growing disconnect—maybe the message isn’t reaching the masses. 

You mentioned Sukumar Ray—his voice, though layered with humor, connected widely. Nabarun Bhattacharya was powerful, but not as accessible.

I was in school when I saw Khosla ka Ghosla. And even today, I feel it is one of the best Hindi films I've watched. Same goes for Oye Lucky. To reduce the film to just patriarchy and diminish his brilliant storytelling to WhatsApp University is baffling. It just seems he is trying to win over a bunch of intellectuals who have brainwashed him. 

Love how Samdish puts him in his place when he addresses the interview with Omar Abdullah. 

Sigh! This is such a disappointing and inauthentic interview which is so rare when Samdish is interviewing. Omar Abdullah and Tej Pratap were more genuine than this guy. Can't believe this is the OG Dibakar Banerjee.

jUo-LlC7qZk,@SanskkritiPriyambda,"SUBJECT- I have something to talk about, which this society might not be ready to listen to. 

Hello Samdish Bhatiya,

I hope you are doing well. I resonate deeply with the content you produce, finding solace in the belief that ""Sab kuch itna bura bhi nahi hai jitna hame abhi tak sikhaya gaya tha"" (""Everything isn't as bad as we've been taught""). At 24 years old, I no longer seek out individuals with prestigious names in various industries; instead, I value authenticity and honesty. The decline of Bollywood, though subjective, mirrors the awakening of a more enlightened society we aspire to become.

Since discovering your work, I haven't missed a single episode. Its unique essence captivates me. I feel like I should speak with you because I have insights that deserve attention from society or those capable of doing change.

I'm reaching out with a request for empathy and understanding. It's evident that you're experienced in engaging with individuals for your interviews, and I admire your ability to connect with people. Our dialogue could be meaningful and productive. I ask you to empathize with me and understand the importance of respectful communication.

I firmly believe we will meet one day, and I have faith in my ability to make it happen. The cause I wish to discuss is one I'm committed to addressing. Starting this work sooner rather than later will greatly benefit society.",0,2024-02-21T11:11:28Z

I wish new generation people don't leave India ignoring its current condition rather than working collectively on India's growth, the new generation or at least one generation should have clean intent that we will work for this nation.

I thought this because I feel my inner child is so hurt and dead, I have not fought for a single dream I saw as a child, how hard has it become to keep your inner child alive.

Then khud hi us statement ko 36:17 Pe contradict kr dia.

Har country apna innate religion hi follow krti h. Islamic countries, christian countries wont be doing shiv tandav at their ceremonies. Hindus or other religious people would have to respect that. + the person who is conducting the ceremony again would follow his religion or the most followed religion. So if he is muslim he will do in his style and hindu will do in his.  unless the ceremony actually calls for a secular gathering. So no point in debating on such trivial and basic thing 
Your omar was making exhibitionism of his religion by wearing it on his sleeve while giving that statement. Showing that he is a victim, felt excluded and seeking attention. I mean there would be sikhs and other religious people too+ diff other minorities, still only he felt excluded? Makes sense much?
+ this opening line of his doesnt relate to anything he says afterwards.",0,2024-10-24T04:30:23Z

Why do southerners feel only 5 languages are in India? Hindi and 4 south languages

The racism and ignorance and being arrogant about it is making me cringe on this guy. Social science padhaata h pr bhadwe ko basic GK nhi pta h.
So many states have multiple languages with theit own scripts/lipi
Iske liye to punjabi/gurbani bi dialect hogi and hindi bolne wale sikhs are the only credible people.
BC how can he say that Uttarakhand and UP people say same language?
Both states have as diff langauges as Punjabi and Tamil. Literally 0 relation between Bhojpuri and Garhwali.

0PTE-iN1Jek,@khawarkhurshidahmedmalik9445,"The Trilogy  Needs To Be A Tetralogy Now
Somebody needs to do an interview with Vishal, for three hours or more, and discuss nothing but The Trilogy. The Trilogy? Yes. The Trilogy of 'Maqbool', 'Omkara' and 'Haider'. Three films that created a new genre in Hindi cinema, lets call it 'indigenised Shakespeare', that began, and ended, with these three films.
Despite ecstatic critical acclaim and commercial success of these films over a  decade and half, no body in Bollywood even attempted to add a fourth one to them in the last whole decade. Why?
 Because Vishal had created a unique template for all three productions that differed totally in a cosmic sense of their context, time, setting, language and tenor. And yet, somehow, retained the umbilical link to the plot, build, characterisation, even the key lines and whole soliloquys, of The Bard's stories. 
I guess the particular difficulty of creating a Vishal-like alternative universe that can emotionally engage both Shakespeare-literate and illiterate among the Indian audience was one reason nobody else from Bollywood ventured forth. But another reason that has struck me while looking at the rest of The Bard's catalogue of work is that a fourth story that can be 'indigenised' as well as these three for the Indian audience is...actually rather hard to find. 
You don't believe me? Surely a Folio of 38 plays by no less than the world's greatest storyteller will have several, may be even a dozen, great stories to develop, you might say. Theoretically yes. But remember, we are looking not just any, but a certain kind of great story; 
one that can be recast in the present day Indian context with as many mysteries and mystiques, plot twists and shocks as Macbeth, Othelo and Hamlet, the plays that provided the core for Vishal Bhardwaj's Maqbool, Omkara and Haider.  
I'm not saying that there are none, for I have myself selected a few of them which I would discuss towards the end of this article. All I'm saying is that in the first cursory analysis, most plays in the Folio seem 'unfilmable' from Bollywood standpoint. If you are prepared to hear my arguments, they are as follows. 
First, there is the problem with the categories. I would argue that of the 10 plays each classified as 'Histories' and 'Tragedies',  and another 18 classified as 'Comedies', more than two dozen cannot even be in the reckoning for our purpose. 
I mean none of the 18 'Comedies' can be considered for production of a film if they are to match the dark, suspenseful and emotionally high-strung dramas of The Trilogy.  The 10 'Histories', on the other hand, should not be considered either because as legendary accounts of 'War Of The Roses', they are too topical to the pre-Elizabethan English Kingdom. They are not devoid of fascinating characters or high dramatic content so I have considered some of them. 
The useful category for a story to recast in the Indian mould of circumstance and characters, in the Vishal Bhardwaj universe, is that of 10 'Tragedies', of which three have been used up in making his Trilogy. 
That leaves us with seven plays in all ; Romeo & Juliet, King Lear, Julius Cesare,  Antony & Cleopatra, Coriolanus, Timon Of Athens, Titus Andronicus. 
Of these, Romeo & Juliet is regarded as Shakespeare's greatest sonnet to love and for that reason has been put on celluloid extensively (some say to death) in virtually every language, and every country's cinema, including Bollywood.  It is lacking in intensity of emotion (other than love) and its high dramatic moments seem exaggerated, or somewhat false, no matter how you film it for screen. 
King Lear is, practically, unfilmable. It is a long series of lengthy soliloquys delivered scene after scene by the mad king that are answered by his Fool in witty one-liners. There are seemingly only two characters in the play with all the other characters fading out within the first few scenes. If you want to make Baiju Bavra all over again with Baiju and a servant making a commentary on man's place in the world in harangues and jests, this is your script. 
Julius Cesare is a highly political play which has everything from high-intrigue to dramatic murder thru stabbings by turn on the Senate floor, a charged up mob, public oratory, a war and eventual defeat of the conspirators who, then choose death for themselves. 
It is a brilliant script for conversion into a political or gangster movie. But it is sorely lacking in that basic salve of all Bollywood films, romance. There is virtually zero scope for a love song or a raunchy dance number because the only woman in the story is Cesare's frightened wife in one scene where she implores him to care for his own safety.
Timon Of Athens and Titus Andronicus, even as plays, are regarded poorly by critics of The Bard. Titus Andronicus is unsuitable for modern day cinema because of extraordinary gore and revolting actions of the main character, which the audience would find unacceptable, to say nothing of the censors. Timon of Athens is one man's venting of spleen against his former friends and his city. 
Both the remaining plays, Coriolanus, and Antony & Cleopatra, are my proposed choices for making an addition, or two, to the Vishal Trilogy. Antony & Cleopatra has romance, conspiracy, wars and high drama culminating in lovers suiciding for one another. The story is compelling enough to take us along on the ride to a magnificent crescendo. 
Coriolanus is also a beautiful story of a Roman General who brings glory to Rome but his lack of servility towards citizenry turns them against him. They banish him for arrogance.
 He, in turn, joins the invading forces of their enemies, Volscians. Then, Rome is his to conquer but he is persuaded by impassioned pleas of his mother and wife to spare the city. He does so but his new Volscian allies kill him for this treason. 
Last of all, I would like to mention a 'History' play that I think has more potential than either of the two scripts mentioned above. This is Richard III. The principle character of this story is one of the most fascinating villain of history and Shakespeare has done a masterly intricate work of crafting his portraiture.
This hunchback kills a king and his heir, woos and marries the heir's wife, then kills that newly-wed wife, kills his two nephews, all in the quest for crown of England. He dies on the battlefield, in the end, defending that crown. 
Stories from Shakespeare are a gift of world's most celebrated literature. That, it can be turned into high class, box office smashing  cinema for our local audience by this mere sleight of the hand in script is shown to us by Vishal Bhardwaj. I wonder if anyone else would do that again and if not, perhaps Vishal can be persuaded and cajoled into doing, may be, just another?",2,2024-06-04T14:40:04Z

0PTE-iN1Jek,@RashminderKaurindia,"The entire episode was a poetic and lyrical in its vibe. Vishal ji is a refined man. I just wanted to point out that while it's true we don't and we cannot carry the weight of entire world on our shoulders, yet if you live in a time when chaos and injustice is on the rise, if you are not too young or too old or sick to do anything, if you are educated and if you have basic security then it becomes your social responsibility to contribute towards ending of a disrupting cycle and restoration of harmony. If all freedom fighters thought...arey British hai,  kal apni bhi sarkar aa hi jayegi but do nothing concrete to bring that change...if that complacency existed we would have never attained freedom as a nation. So there are always times for action and never shy from that responsibility because the illiterate, helpless poor person cannot see the way out...the privileged ones have to wake up and act before anyone else. Every context is not suitable to easy going attitude, resistance is needed when it's time to do so...and like Buddha you can do it with utmost non attachment, you can fight a disharmonious force without any hatred.",0,2024-02-06T06:43:50Z

उसके लिए समाज के विकास के लिए सिर्फ बातें ही हैं । जमीन पर सिर्फ कट्टरपंथियों को प्रोत्साहित करने की हरकतें करता रहता है। 

अब जनता समझ लें उमर को क्या काना चाहिए कश्मीर में जिस से वो देश की जनता  का विश्वास जीत सकता है : 
१) कश्मीर की आवाम को बता दे कि पाक से भारत अगर बात करेगा तो सिर्फ पाक समर्थित आतंकवाद के बंद होने के लिए और pok हासिल करने के लिए ... और यही  stand भारत का आज भी है। पर इस पर उमर चुप हैं ..?
२) cm बनने के बाद से अब तक आतंकवाद informers को कश्मीर में धड़ पकड़ने का बयान  जारी करे जिस से उनकी विश्वनीयता देश की जनता के प्रति दिखेगी।  
३) आर्टिकल 370 हटाने के सपोर्ट पर ( जो अब एक कानून बन चुका है ) उमर फारुक  देश को विश्वास में लेने के लिए एक बयान जारी करे। 

ऊपर लिखित बातों पर एक्शन ले और फिर देखिए , उनको स्टेटहुड भी मिल जायेगा। 

देश आपको स्टेटहुड देकर फिर ऐसे ही कश्मीर को 1989 वाले नरसंहार वाली फारुक कांड दोबारा नहीं होने देखा। ये समझ लें उमर फारुक..

Nationlistic support needs to be on top most agenda of kashmir if omar wants to be nation wide leader... 
Otherwise he is like second pappu like deshdrohi Rahu khan..

अब इस दोगले उमर का देश क्या करे ..

ये कश्मीर में अमन लाने में नाकामयाब हो चुके हैं। पहलगाम घटना भी इनकी पाक इनफॉर्मर को नहीं पकड़ने के प्रयास का ही नतीजा है और ये जनता भी जानती है। 

उमर फारुक अपने को ज्यादा होशियार नहीं समझें ... 

आप दोगले बयान और कट्टरपंथी हरकतों  से देश की जनता को कभी गुमराह नहीं कर सकेंगे। 

हिम्मत है अगर उमर फारुक में तो कश्मीर में बड़ा काम करें कुछ जैसे ऊपर लिखी तीन बातों का जिक्र किया गया है। 

इधर उधर की बात करने से उमर टुच्चे लगते हैं ... उनको पता होना चाहिए

Why don’t more community leaders openly speak out against radical influences or the hate being spread by certain external groups? Why not guide people more actively towards the true, peaceful teachings of Islam, instead of allowing space for those who glorify violence or mock others' pain?

And if everything was as balanced and fair as described, then why do some people in Kashmir still want to join Pakistan? Why are some still getting influenced or brainwashed by extremist ideas? Isn’t that an irony?

Their propoganda of muslim being subjugated is highly far from truth as if so why always terror started by muslim on kashmiri hindu ( when everybody was living in peace) etc many other places blasts scene and not only in india but worldwide . Equality among equals and now when one religion is awakening for its mere basic standpoint (withiut any violence but voice ) why muslims are feeling threatening in india.

Believe me when I say this but majority of these people aren't as poor as they show. They have ACs, bikes, washing machines inside these homes.

Problem to dikhayi gayi, lekin na toh sarkar se sahi sawaal poochhe gaye, aur na hi unke afsaron se accountability li gayi. Har baar ek hi purana raga — 'rules aur regulations' ka hawala dekar demolition justify kar diya jata hai. Agar wahi rules lagu kiye jayein, to Delhi ka 70% hissa iske daayre mein aa jaata hai.

'Sundarta' ke naam par jo kuch ho raha hai, uske peeche asal mein sheher ke gareeb aur mazloom tabke ko hi nishana banaya ja raha hai. Bina kisi proper rehabilitation ke logon ko ujaad diya gaya, jiske baad unke paas na chhat bachi, na rozgaar.

Aaj haal yeh hai ki poore desh mein gareebi aur berozgaari se joojhte logon ki ek 'bhikhariyon ki fauj' khadi ho rahi hai — aur hum sirf tamasha dekh rahe hain.

""Why?"" because, he is a politician, he had a large amount of supporting and other, so called netaji's, behing him. It's all about a story, you can't make a story out of sports person winning against ""MLA"", in this country called India. There is MLA's supremacy, a sportsperson does not find any role in the politics of India. A MLA can do anything in the parliament but a sportsman can't because ""netaji ne vote kmane ke lia bdi mehnat ki hae na"" aur aek sportsman ne aesa tesi firvai hae medal laane ke lia, without any good and proper infrastructure in the country.",1,2023-08-17T04:45:39Z

Our biggest fault is that we forget easily. Our memory span is too little. And after these drastic changes in history text books, we won't even remember our origin.

Jitna naam in players in apne desh ka kia hai is hisaab se poore desh ko inke sath sadak pe utar jana chahiye tha lekin ho kya raha hae ?? Kitne log aaye sath dene. Ye hai sach is desh ki janta ka aur is desh ki sarkar ka. Kuch mutthibhar logo ko chor kar kisi ko koi lena dena nahi kiske sath kya ho raha hae aur kya nahi. Beech road pe kisi ka rape ho jata hae kisi ke tukde kar diye jaate hae lekin phir bhi ye chutia public bas dekhti hae tamasha . Baad me kehti hae ki is desh me hae kya rehne layak isliye bahar chalte haen. Saalo apna Ghar rehne layak ban sake isliye uski safai aur dekh rekh ki responsibility hamari khud ki hoti hae na ki kisi bahar Wale ki. Kal ko jab shaheen baagh me log protest kar rahe the to ye wrestler unke against the aur sarkar ko support kar rahe the . Aaj samay ka pahiya ghuma aur ye usi jagah baithe hain aur inke sath wahi log galat kar rahe hain jinka sath ye de rhe the. Tab bhi public hath pe hath rkh k baithi thi aaj bhi wahi haal hae. Aaj aap log ye soch rhe ho ki un k sath ho raha hae wo dekh lenge hamara kya lena dena is sabse . Yahi pe unity khatam ho jati hae is desh ki. Kal ko jo kuch logo k sath hua wo aaj inke sath ho raha hae aur kal ko aap ke sath bhi hoga aur aap isi ummeed se baithe rhoge ki koi ayega hamara sath dene aur baaki ki public bhi yahi soch ke baithi rahegi ki hamara kya lena dena in sabse.

But my question after watching many of an hour interviews, what happens to the entire 2 hours of it LOL. is it like Noise can not make Noise cancellation headphones because its againts their brand lol bad example but hope you got my point. overall lovely work you do man kudos

Edit- I have left the regular netflix shows and spending that time here so my apologies if i am commenting on some old videos here, since i am trying to catch up. Overall lovely concept, good content.",0,2024-05-14T18:18:18Z

CTC5X14BwPM,@raistantray244,"""I don’t know who in your team looks after the comment sections of your videos, but I hope this comment reaches you as it might be important. You're aware that individuals outside the governmental system can often offer ideas or suggestions that are more innovative or flexible than those within the government. You yourself exemplify this idea; you've proposed ideas to Punjab CM and Supriya Sule about Nitin Gadkari, which they found interesting. This ability stems from being at the grassroots level of the country, enabling you to understand problems deeply. However, one aspect related to your career is worth considering: it would be beneficial for you to broaden the scope of your interviews. One important step would be to engage with local journalists in the area, district, or state before conducting interviews with leaders from that region. This approach would allow you to gain insights from the grassroots level and provide a broader reality check or perspective for your questioning methods when interviewing leaders.

I felt someone aged or mature person would have taken her interview , as i bearly saw her giving interviews, kuch questions toa bilkul jhaley se hote hai since I saw your first Pod don't know about others aur ye apne feet uper rakh k bethna koi aisa nhi ki nhi karo gy toa apshukan ho jaye ga 😅, basharte koi anklet vgera pehna ho like u wore on Kapil show and showing it too, deliberately 😂.",0,2025-08-21T10:58:49Z

I appreciate that she honestly opened up her views but definitely not agree with them... especially the ones on marriage, companionship, young generation,  dating apps, acting training etc... one doesn't need to study acting to be a good actor... and nor do all professionally trained actors good... for her biggest example should be Alia bhatt... not trained in FTI or NSD, she is effortless and a great actor, even received the national award this  year. So i guess seema ji doesnt have  to be so rigid,  judgemental and anal about these things.  Nature  means change... even her generation is different than her grand mothers generation.. so we should be forthcoming and accepting... rather  than  cribbing over these issues which are bound to happen... life ka matlab change  hai...!!

I have never seen such a humorous and down to earth leader.. What ever he told about the problem of ADC and tribal people are absolutely correct, but tribals are also getting opportunities in govtment jobs and other services. The only problem is that the area of ADC is still undeveloped.. 
And yes if Bengali people in Tripura keeps on increasing, tribals have to fight for their survival, there is nothing wrong in that. But violence is what makes everything messed up.",26,2023-02-26T06:39:49Z

My opinion is different about this interview. I felt the interview was beautiful and rare. Yes, there was personality contrasting but it wasn't cold or unkind. Sir is serious reserve person. Samdish is not a stupid. It's just personsa, the chaotic energy he shows. Tbh i believe he's quite intelligent and smart. I'm sure he is quite depth person in his personal life. I'm sensitive person yet i thought this interview was authentic, grounding and sincere. In the end what Sir said about his experience and the way Samdish reply his 'thsnk you'. It was heart warming.

Actually the thing is Saurabh sir didn't even thought about it, he was actually unfiltered. For the first time I laughed minimal while watching your video (It was one of your best video I would say for various reasons) and I realised that you always tries to act which barely someone would have noticed about your character, and just because of Saurabh sir I get to know it's not unfiltered. His character was so overpowered that make this whole experience overwhelmed  in itself, I don't have words to express how much depth he had, in his all the statements right from the starting. So yes I'm disappointed because it's not ""theek thaak interview"" maybe you think so but always laughing don't makes someone entertained, Smiling do better whether the smile involves any emotion doesn't matter it could be happy, it could be unhappy and it could definitely be IDK how I felt I just liked it.",1,2023-06-28T17:05:47Z

Understandable that in content game, people have to build their own style but eventually they are all vying for shock factor and eyeballs. Others do it openly and I have always found that this host seems to think he can cover it up with his mannerisms but like Saurabh pointed out, its not hidden from viewers and clearly Samdish also knows its a lie that is why he was stunned to silence that he couldnt recover for the rest of the interview.

4LPO3hne_2Y,@diyachakraborty4742,"That ending 😂 I also felt like Shukhlaji was kinda rude with Samdish but then Samdish is the one who usually makes people uncomfortable and then it's up to the interviewee to mend the situation and redeem their gravity - sooo I guess it must have been interesting for Samdish to taste his own medicine for once.

Again, the ending - unparalleled. It's obvious that he didn't like Samdish from the get go and that's understandable. Engaging charm and projected charm are different things and I feel like Samdish has gone from the former to the latter in recent years. Genuine people who are not full of themselves do not respect manipulation of any kind if they can track it. 

Also, not to seem too harsh about a personally inspirational interviewer/""content creator"" - Samdish does seem to excel more with politicians than people from the film industry. It's a matter of personal interest area and/or knowledge area too when it comes to interview alignment, so that might be a factor as well.",28,2023-06-21T06:58:36Z

I like your style when you go from one question to another with no relation to each other and then come back to it, it hits you because lot of time ppl forget about question but you come back on it.
Part i dont like is please dont interrup someone in between when he/ she giving u answer or trying to explain his views.
It might be your style of taking interview. But it distrube the rythm of the interview.
Again thts my personal opinion and its not just about this interview most of the interviews i watched of yours.

Kanhaiya Kumar, Kunal Kamra, Javed Akhtar, Naseer Shah are never anti authority but anti ideology. Only if people knew that even Bhagat Singh was anti authority to his core. No doubt people would have labelled him anti national if he was alive. Irrespective of the ideology, there has been and there will be no leader elected from the current process that's any different.

jZN4G2FFDV0,@euphoric9570,"Why this video is so short 🥺. I was back at my village for like a month (that's why didn't watched the video earlier), and everyone is talking about election. Like for himachali people they know ""chaar bude kne biddi"" . Being from a family which is very much politically active it was interesting to know different opinions. One thing that i also liked is mutual respect that people shared even after knowing that the another person is goin to vote for another party. 

For rest of people: 
AAP is feared, as it will bring destruction, its leading in Punjab, people love peace in state so they still don't want them to be in power ,
BJP: though done a lot of work on ground , like i have personally seen the growth in my town or district i'll say, the doubt of NPS and OPS is there in crowd ,still jai ram didn't left any major mark on people like as CM , people will vote for bjp to indirectly vote to modi (like my own family). 
Congress: HP was congress ruled state for longest time and with the face of CM being raja ji , people loved him respected him (though corruption was there), but he was people's king, he was very able to take stand and decision against his own party also, but congress in centre have affected the state too, as now his son is new face . There are people voting for Congress as a ""family party"" so there are strong chances for cong to win",0,2022-11-19T17:02:27Z

_9SXoI1q56Y,@sayantanbhaumik3060,I think this is the first time I am watching such a long interview for second time. Vineet's talks seem refreshing and genuine.  His sacrifice of a well trodden path is inspiring. Unfortunately it still seems he hasn't gotten what he was looking for and it shows the section of people who strive so hard and maybe even harder than people who become successful but still can't achieve success due to elements contributing to success which are not in one's control. I wish Vineet all the best! There are many people like me who don't know what they want or want too many things or don't want things with an intensity to persevere and face so much suffering. It's fascinating for me personally to see someone persevere so much for something they want. Kahaan se aata hai itni chahat !!!,2,2024-12-03T13:23:42Z

8RO1AVlWVVw,@SanskkritiPriyambda,"SUBJECT- I have something to talk about, which this society might not be ready to listen to. 

Hello Samdish Bhatiya,

I hope you are doing well. I resonate deeply with the content you produce, finding solace in the belief that ""Sab kuch itna bura bhi nahi hai jitna hame abhi tak sikhaya gaya tha"" (""Everything isn't as bad as we've been taught""). At 24 years old, I no longer seek out individuals with prestigious names in various industries; instead, I value authenticity and honesty. The decline of Bollywood, though subjective, mirrors the awakening of a more enlightened society we aspire to become.

Since discovering your work, I haven't missed a single episode. Its unique essence captivates me. I feel like I should speak with you because I have insights that deserve attention from society or those capable of doing change.

I'm reaching out with a request for empathy and understanding. It's evident that you're experienced in engaging with individuals for your interviews, and I admire your ability to connect with people. Our dialogue could be meaningful and productive. I ask you to empathize with me and understand the importance of respectful communication.

I firmly believe we will meet one day, and I have faith in my ability to make it happen. The cause I wish to discuss is one I'm committed to addressing. Starting this work sooner rather than later will greatly benefit society.",0,2024-02-21T11:11:47Z

D1zOaU8E1G4,@SanskkritiPriyambda,"SUBJECT- I have something to talk about, which this society might not be ready to listen to. 

Hello Samdish Bhatiya,

I hope you are doing well. I resonate deeply with the content you produce, finding solace in the belief that ""Sab kuch itna bura bhi nahi hai jitna hame abhi tak sikhaya gaya tha"" (""Everything isn't as bad as we've been taught""). At 24 years old, I no longer seek out individuals with prestigious names in various industries; instead, I value authenticity and honesty. The decline of Bollywood, though subjective, mirrors the awakening of a more enlightened society we aspire to become.

Since discovering your work, I haven't missed a single episode. Its unique essence captivates me. I feel like I should speak with you because I have insights that deserve attention from society or those capable of doing change.

I'm reaching out with a request for empathy and understanding. It's evident that you're experienced in engaging with individuals for your interviews, and I admire your ability to connect with people. Our dialogue could be meaningful and productive. I ask you to empathize with me and understand the importance of respectful communication.

I firmly believe we will meet one day, and I have faith in my ability to make it happen. The cause I wish to discuss is one I'm committed to addressing. Starting this work sooner rather than later will greatly benefit society.",0,2024-02-21T11:13:45Z

Pakistan mein hindu 22% se 1% pe kese agye, hum hindu bahut jyada sahan karen hai aur nhi. Mein ek baat bolu, agar congress ke jagah bjp rehta independence ke time to partition nhi hota. Muslim log galat nhi lekin kuran galat hai, 1984 me supreme coart ke judge ne bhi ye jari kiyatha tha ki kuran ke 28 ayate galat hai jo dusre dharam ko nicha dikhata hai aur bharat ko islamic aur Christian country banane ke liye pehle bhi prayas hua tha aur aj bhi hai.

Modi ki gar chiz se main bhi sahmat nhi hun par aap ek baat batao modi aane ke baad bharat mein kitne terrorists atrack hua hai?? Bharat ko hindurastra hume banane hai aur hum iske liye kuch bhi kr sakte hai kyu ki Kashmir se pandito ko sirf hibdu hone ke karan bhagaya gya tha, azadi se pehle lahore mein 50% hindu sikh the,   aur saare paise wale the, aaj dhundne par hindu sikh nhi milenge, paise ki zaroorat hai lekin sabse pehle dharam ki raksha zaroori hai. In communist aur Congressio ko bolo secular humara desh kabhi nhi tha ye 1976 mein indira ne zabardasti ghusaya tha. Hum hindu rastra hai the aur rahenge. Hinduo ko aur kattar banna padega. Jese pakistan mein communisto ko jeene nhi dete bharat mein bhi wo tarika apnana padega.

I am in Melbourne Australia and would love to have a coffee here in the coffee capital of the world ..if you are ever down here… and would love to listen to any anecdotes from your unfiltered journey…

pkeUWYeDweA,@SanskkritiPriyambda,"SUBJECT- I have something to talk about, which this society might not be ready to listen to. 

Hello Samdish Bhatiya,

I hope you are doing well. I resonate deeply with the content you produce, finding solace in the belief that ""Sab kuch itna bura bhi nahi hai jitna hame abhi tak sikhaya gaya tha"" (""Everything isn't as bad as we've been taught""). At 24 years old, I no longer seek out individuals with prestigious names in various industries; instead, I value authenticity and honesty. The decline of Bollywood, though subjective, mirrors the awakening of a more enlightened society we aspire to become.

Since discovering your work, I haven't missed a single episode. Its unique essence captivates me. I feel like I should speak with you because I have insights that deserve attention from society or those capable of doing change.

I'm reaching out with a request for empathy and understanding. It's evident that you're experienced in engaging with individuals for your interviews, and I admire your ability to connect with people. Our dialogue could be meaningful and productive. I ask you to empathize with me and understand the importance of respectful communication.

I firmly believe we will meet one day, and I have faith in my ability to make it happen. The cause I wish to discuss is one I'm committed to addressing. Starting this work sooner rather than later will greatly benefit society.",0,2024-02-21T11:13:06Z

uFz5twF2PNg,@MasterTg-wj5sd,"Why, India? 😔😟

Why don't we stand up for what's right? If a customer pays only ₹10 or ₹15 when they owe ₹20, it's not just unfair — it's disrespectful. Why don't we defend those who are wronged, even in small situations like this? Are we only going to focus on religion, ignoring the basic values of justice, fairness, and responsibility?

We — the youth — are the future of this country. If we don’t speak up and take action, then what will we be proud of? People say India has the 4th largest GDP in the world (which is true in terms of nominal GDP), but when someone asks “What about GDP per capita?” — we fall behind. As of now, India ranks much lower in GDP per capita globally, meaning that while our economy is big, the average income per person is still quite low.

So the real question is: Are we building a country based on numbers alone, or one where every citizen is respected and protected — economically, socially, and morally?

It’s time to change, and that change starts with us.",0,2025-06-02T07:59:27Z

i79S-HsD56s,@Master_of_faltu_things,"Reality ye hai ki peechali sarkar mein saman sasti toh milti thi par availability kam thi , is wali sarkar ne available toh karaya hai lekin milta paise se hi hai free ka bus kaha jata hai, jaise rasaan harwaqt free nahi milta lekin sasta milta hai kabhi kabar saal bhar mein 2 month ka paisa nahi dena padhta baki time paise dekar hi rasan milta hai pr market ke daam se kam mein kharid kar milta hai.
Cylinder 1800 ka sirf connection mila tha jaha connection nahi tha uske baad har bar refill krne ka paisa lgta hai ₹1200 Jb jyda mehnga ho aur sasta ho toh 950₹ tak. Free mein toh kuch bhi nahi hai awaas yojana bhi jo pardhan ko paise  deta hai usi ko milta hai baki ka nam cut kr diya jata hai. Aap 10k denge pardhan ko toh sarkaar ka 80k wo dega. Sauchalaya ka bhi wahi haal hai paise denge toh thoda uske adhik paisa aapko mil jayega. Sarkari school ki vawastha wahi hai midday meal ke naam pr humesha khichadi hi diya jata hai adhiktam jagah par. Dhoodh anda ye sb nahi milta. Iska paisa pardhan khata hai. Aur pardhani mein jativad bahot hota hai 5 saal ke karyawars mein koi 1 -2 kaam karyega pardhan usme bhi adha paisa kha kar. Rasan ka tendor bhi usi ko dete hai jo already rasan ka chori karta hai. Mein ye nahi keh rahi BJP kaam nahi krti , karti hai beshak ki hai lekin corruption kr krke bacha hua paisa gaw tak pahuchta hai tb jake koi kaam hota hai wo bhi basic kaam. Gaw mein sirf kacchi road hoti hai khule nale hote hai gay bhains bhi log road pr bandhi jati hai. Jo gaw develop dikhega usme bhi sarkar ka yogdaan nhi hota blki waha ka yuwa ka hota hai jo vichar ke bade hote hai kuch bhi krke padha likha kr apne baccho ko saskat banate hai wahi jake apna personal ghar ko develop kr pate hai mere gaw mein toh har bar alag pardhan banta hai aur jo banta hai gareeb se ameer hojata hai. Aise hi krke humare gaw mein toh vikash hua hai. Kuch log hai jo pardhan banane se phle kuch kiye hai taki chunaw jeet sake lekin jeetne ke baad personal vikas kiya sirf gaw ka nahi.",0,2025-08-18T09:32:01Z

Kqv4-Y4d590,@Allthesewords,"26:00 - 26:06 : Dear Samdish, I enjoy your work so much! I felt I could take the liberty of sharing a thought. Leaders come up from within difficult circumstances. It is the real life experience with unfairness that prepares a leader to speak up for, and against what needs to change in society. We are constantly moving towards that ideal society where everyone has a fair life. I've taken a long time in reaching this particular interview, but what a delightful one it is. He has come up from the unfairness to head the state, albeit for a small time. - A rather 'unaware of the details of Indian Punjab politics' Keralite. 

Systemic issues of the nation unite us all. All these words have come up in the face of the system. I hope the days come when Samdish interviews more of these central stars in the galaxies of India.

A hindu has never been reluctant in saying Eid Mubarak or going to Mosque but look at the Muslims they were fighting legal case for their , normal human ruler made ,mosque babri against Hindus for whom it is a holiest place where our prabhu shri ram was born. It has always being one sided love affair of hindus towards Muslims. Muslims rarely ,*Sunni* typically, came ahead to involve in Hindu culture as compared to Hindus. We all know thousands of examples where Muslims were appeased and being loved by the Hindus and governments.

Until and unless Liberals don't try to go into the skin of majority's sentiments and emotions, they won't get what they're looking for.
In the name of secularism, the natural emotions and instincts were repressed on a very large scale, right from the government to media to entertainment industry to schools to businesses and all.
It's true that BJP-RSS have garnered their politics on this repression. But calling it a 'manufactured' sentiment will harm liberals and seculars more than anyone. 
PS. Things like lynching, Adharm Sabha, etc are the extremes which are outgrowths growing on this sentiment. Must be condemned, but addressed in a thorough, wholesome manner.",20,2022-01-05T14:18:04Z

Gi5e05gh4OY,@shrutijani2872,"Hi Samdish have been watching your content for a while now and very excited to see you back. Unfortunately, this interview felt hollow. While it started off strong, very little was spoken about the current government or issues. It soon tettered the lines of a casual gossip session. Kanhaiya was trying to get into depth about issues like talking about the PM and his aides, unfortunately you kept cutting him off, trying to get a biography on Rahul Gandhi which is not what audiences are here for. I really appreciate you breaking traditional rules of interviewing but that shouldn't deter you from talking about real issues like his views on the Centre, why did he leave CPIM, why does he not speak about Umar Khalid or where he sees Congress going. Please consider this as constructive feedback from a loyal viewer. Hoping to see better content soon :) best of luck!",0,2022-01-08T06:44:25Z
