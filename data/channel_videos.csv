glCkSw1bCa8,The Film Critic No One Asked For ft. Imran Khan,"The best tongue twister award goes to the lovely people I met at Tamnay’s workshop and in this episode of Unfiltered by Samdish, I impart that wisdom to the self-confessed movie geek, Imran Khan. 

From obsessing over films and storytelling to reflecting on life away from the public eye, from past work experiences to upcoming projects, from never actively chasing money to the overwhelming feeling of having enough, from hating the birthday attention to loving his Filmfare hosting experience, Imran talks about what it means to step back, slow down, and return on his own terms.

The conversation also weaves through his fascinating family tree, a bag of all sorts of people and how that mix shaped who he is today.

Thoughtful, nerdy, and refreshingly honest. 

Here’s presenting, The Film Critic No One Asked For ft. Imran Khan",2025-12-26T14:31:31Z,765925,30168,2172,24,PT1H2M26S,hd
f22L9t_G0-A,"One CM At A Time (If You Know, You Know) - Sorry Conrad","For this episode, I travelled all the way to Shillong to meet the Chief Minister of Meghalaya, Conrad Sangma.

Very much a Delhi boy, raised in the power corridors of Lutyens’ Delhi, Sangma today leads one of the largest political parties in the North-East, an inheritance from his father, but a legacy he is carving out in his own way.

Against the stunning backdrop of Shillong, Sangma spoke candidly about his political journey, his CM duties, his failures, and why he couldn’t inherit his wife’s property (???).

Between laughs, jokes, and the occasional roast, the discussion also spanned to corruption in the North-Eastern states, rat-hole mining in Meghalaya, and his relationship with the BJP.

And finally, the toughest question of all: is Conrad Sangma the coolest Chief Minister in India? You’ll find out by the end of this video.

Gn8A_GsAxLA,I Discovered The Tribal Culture Like Never Before| @MainBhiBharat,"Trigger Warning:
This video contains scenes of eating silkworms and pork. Viewer discretion is advised.

To be inspired to make a video by going on the ground and meeting people is one thing, but to be inspired through a video is something else entirely.
Once upon a time, Samdish had a desire to meet a veteran, Shyam Sunder, who runs a YouTube channel called Main Bhi Bharat, featuring a show named Tribal Kitchen. As Anthony Bourdain once said, “Open your mind, get up off the couch, move.” Well, Samdish did exactly that.
This video is about what differentiates a traveller from a tourist. It’s about understanding just how diverse this country truly is -its ways of living and eating. It’s about two deeply passionate people who simply love to MOVE.

The conversation moved from his film career and his craft to the sense that he’s made peace with the fact that he doesn’t want to join politics (at least for now). I did what I had to do: vibe, talk about his art, and somewhere try to catch him by a whisker of a hair.

Lying in the lowlands of Himalayas at the Bihar-Nepal border is the Tharuat; Home to the Indigenous Tharu Community.

A day with the people of the tribe turned into something truly special: stories that made us pause and faces full of warmth. This is why we keep coming back to Bihar, because beyond the politics and the headlines, there’s heart. It wasn’t just another shoot, it was a reminder of how beautiful everyday life can be when lived with joy.

Come, spend this day with us. You’ll see why we can’t stay away from Bihar for too long.

Phir aa gaya hoon Bihar!This time to meet my ‘friend’ (only if he doesn’t try to cut my moustache in two minutes), the son of Lalu Yadav and brother of Tejashwi Yadav — Tej Pratap Yadav.But things felt different this time. The man and the madness were the same, yet the air had changed; the rhythm of the place had shifted.And in all this, I either tried to see through what Tej Pratap feels about the Bihar elections or maybe I just enjoyed the helicopter ride with him.

That’s where I found Launda Naach; a performance filled with dance, rebellion and survival. And at the heart of it all was Kumar Uday Singh: an artist, a performer, a man holding up a mirror to a world that rarely looks back.

Presenting, We Finally Decided To Create a New Show: This is the UF Concerts

kiWlylsf1yE,"Bihar Ki Baat, Seedha Tejashwi Yadav Ke Saath","Bihar isn’t just a stop on the map anymore; it’s beginning to feel like a second home. I sat face to face with Tejashwi Yadav, the RJD’s young face, to talk about the issues that weigh heavily here: corruption, migration, politics, and the scars and triumphs that come with them. Our conversation drifted to Bihar’s larger political mood, the frustrations and the glimpses of hope. And somewhere between the gravity of it all, we found space to laugh, tossing a few jokes back and forth like Sachin Tendulkar squaring off against Glenn McGrath.

In this frank and unfiltered conversation, PK goes deep: the ground reality of Bihar, Jan Suraaj as organisation, his “actual” role in the party, Nitish Kumar’s health versus political will. How much of Lalu’s popularity is nostalgia and how much is just the lack of good options? 

From young Bihar politicians Tejashwi Yadav and Chirag Paswan, to Rahul Gandhi’s allegations against the Election Commission, and the SIR in Bihar, this interview covers it all. There’s even banter about our last viral interview and how many people watched it. Watch, question, argue, and laugh with us. This isn’t just an interview, it’s PK, Unfiltered.

Team Unfiltered travelled to Jaipur to meet a survivor of the divide who also happens to be the best storyteller we have ever met. From stories of '46 conflict on the lines of religion to the war stories of '65, from leaving Urdu behind in his school to the current longing to go back and visit Khyber Pakhtun, this 90 year old charmer has it all. 

In an endeavour to keep the stories of the survivors of partition always alive, here's presenting, The Ultimate Baddie - The Greatest Indian Alive.

Happy Independence Day to you too.

z_0AsDS_p9A,Is This The Deadliest Secret of Our Country? | Inside India's Worst Health Crisis ,"For most, working is a way to survive, but for the mine workers of Karauli, Rajasthan, it has become a slow and painful path to death. This region’s economy heavily depends on stone mining and quarrying, industries that expose workers to deadly silica dust, leading to the incurable disease: Silicosis.

To uncover the reality behind these numbers, the Unfiltered team traveled to Karauli. What we witnessed was far worse than anything we could have anticipated. These workers, bound by poverty and desperation, survive on painkillers just to endure another day of relentless labour. With little compensation, limited awareness, and no alternate livelihood, they are trapped in a vicious cycle, where survival itself is paid for with their health, and eventually, their lives.

Here’s presenting the unfiltered truth of this deadly industry through Bharat Ek Khoj: India's Worst Health Crisis | Unfiltered by Samdish",2025-08-07T14:15:22Z,530553,21730,1594,24,PT24M2S,hd

Amusing to some and embarrassing to others, we decided to speak about the name with the residents of this village to understand more about their lives. Burdened by poverty, poor living conditions, and limited access to education and healthcare, the villagers have resigned themselves to a life without the hope of help from either the state or the media. Now they're just waiting for one thing, their village name to be changed.

Some animals were harmed during the making of this video, but hey, that wasn’t our idea. We just happened to be there.

IV-_RJktVrk,What Happens When Two States Fight Over Territory? Samdish Investigates ,"For this crazy experience, I entered the Kotia territory, which either belongs to Odisha or Andhra Pradesh. One of my teammates, an Odia himself, once told me about the Kondhas of Kotia,  a tribal community caught between two states. People here grow up with two Aadhaar cards, live under two governments, and even vote in both states; peak identity crisis!

Now, I don’t know what it is, but there’s something about these areas that excites me.
So I did the only thing that made sense- Got off my couch, opened my mind, and moved.

YLURkSPMvGM,I ‘Interrogated’ this 92 year old Army Veteran | The OG Indians ,"1947 — a year etched in both gold and blood in the shared history of two nations: India and Pakistan.
But Since then, from cricket pitches to political punches, from loud headlines to quiet graveyards — the rivalry has only grown louder.

However, beneath all the noise, as young Indians, deep down, we all wish to understand our neighbouring country. And who better to talk to than a man who's carried the scars of Partition, not just the stories. Hence, Samdish decided to visit the home of a Partition survivor, a 92 year old Indian Army veteran to ask the question that still echoes across generations:  How do we deal with this neighbour?

9ogf-LiYdlc,What Does an Indian Port Look Like? | Inside One of India’s Oldest Ports,"“The wind may turn back — but a Kharva never does.”

Welcome to the new episode of Bharat EK Khoj. This time, Captain Samdish Bhatia sails 1300 km away from Delhi to the wild, roaring edge of the Arabian Sea — Vanakbara Port in Diu.
Vanakbara is home to a community of fishermen, or Kharvas, who spend 8 out of 12 months sailing the sea, chasing fish and a living. 

We spent days capturing their lives in this cinematic episode. From Thandel Ramesh, a senior captain, to the young Khalasis learning the ropes and telling their stories of resilience and camaraderie.

How do they catch and store fish? How dangerous is the sea? How do they prepare for their trips, and do they even make any money?

HB1lCyEei1Y,OMG: Ye Bhi Mera India?  Inside the Extraordinary African Village of Gujarat,"While the Unfiltered team was travelling for a shoot in Gujarat, we were reminded of a small village in the Gir Somnath district, where an African community resides from hundreds of years. It's considered to be a tourist spot because of the absurd nature of finding a clan as theirs in a remote area of an Indian State. But to our surprise, we discovered that these communities have far more to offer than just a tourist attraction — there’s a depth that goes beyond what meets the eye.

Officially known as the Siddi community, these people refer to one another as badshah, meaning 'king', and it’s not just a title...It's a reflection of their attitude towards life. With an infectious zest, they embrace each day to the fullest with whatever they have and make it all seem to look fun by dancing through life (quite literally, I have to say). 

In our never ending journey of exploring the much overlooked parts of the country. Here's a documentation that will make you say, OMG: Ye Bhi Mera India? Inside the extraordinary Siddis of Gujarat

Kaafi kuch, jo sabne dekha...aur kuch aisa bhi, jo hamari nigaahon se chhoot gaya. Usi doosri category ki ek prastuti lekar, we’re back. A story about five Indian migrant workers who had left their homeland in search of a livelihood abroad, and now their safety is uncertain and their whereabouts, unknown.

On April 25, five workers from Jharkhand’s Giridih district were abducted by armed gunmen in the conflict-hit Tillabéri region of Niger, West Africa. They’re still missing. We decided to head to Giridih to speak to their families caught in grief, confusion, and painful uncertainty. Will this video change anything in the grand scheme of things?  We don’t know. But it’s an attempt to make you more aware of the situation of your fellow citizens.

Happy Valentine’s Day, folks!
For this crazy Valentine’s Day quickie, I found myself in a village in Haryana, face-to-face with the leader of the Raanda (unmarried men) Union. This guy had thoughts—big ones. He, Virendra Sangwan, shared his perspectives on the struggles of single men, and the everyday humiliation they face. Among his demands were a government pension for unmarried men and a special identification card for those who are sexually deprived—to prevent harassment by authorities. Yup, you read that right.

Somewhere between the absurdity and laughter, we also talked about Haryana’s skewed sex ratio, societal expectations, and Virendra Sangwan's personal experiences.

Although I wasn’t really in the mood, I had to be on the ground to cover my city’s election season. I found myself intruding on Somnath Bharti’s door-to-door campaign, not at all trying to blend in and also mentally rating the quality of handshakes and forced smiles. 

Later, I stumbled upon Shikha Rai’s not-so-energetic rally. The crowd looked like they were attending out of sheer boredom—or maybe for the free snacks, who knows? Between awkward slogans and half-hearted cheers, I realized the election might be dull, but luckily, I’m the life of this election season. Hahahaha!

FYI, this man is a Trade Unionist who also happens to be the General Secretary of the CITU (Centre of Indian Trade Unions). Hereby Introducing Comrade Anurag Saxena. 

In an extremely detailed conversation with Anurag, he took me through ‘n’ number of challenges faced by the workers of this country, along with CITU’s role in resolving those issues. Whether it concerns the bad living conditions, inadequate access to healthcare, or the ongoing struggle to receive wages from employers, Anurag gave us quite a vivid picture of the current worker situation. 

In between all this, he also mentioned how a trade unionist like himself struggles to survive in a metropolitan city like Delhi and is hardly making ends meet. While discussions around trade unions have largely disappeared from our everyday lives, this interview is an attempt to fill that space and let these voices out.

Yo! Ki haal chaal?

Happy new year dosto!

Kicking off 2025 with some serious dope content!

For this wild experience —I hopped on a train to Chandigarh (don’t even get me started on my trust issues with that ride) and decked myself out in some top-tier athletic gear. Why? To meet none other than the man who calls himself The Lion, The Emperor of the Universe, and the man who gave us two world cups — Yograj Singh.

We dove deep into his empire of 2,500 acres (yeah, you read that right). He shared his desire to change his bloodline and his constant prayers to God for a new life so he could become the greatest cricketer of all time. He also opened up about his biggest regret—venturing into acting—and many other personal revelations.

Oh, and the story of how Yograj Singh believes he was born in the wrong country? Absolute madness.

From the ruthless world of sports politics to the time he pointed a pistol at Kapil Dev, this man has spoken about it all.

Spoiler alert: I low-key tried to be his therapist for a bit during this chat. Did it work? Maybe. Maybe not. One thing’s for sure, though—this guy is built different.

Yeh Jodi bawaal kaat degi.

Kaise ho, thik ho?

It's a wrap for the year 2024. Just before you take a vacation and go on a chill vibe (feeling extremely sorry for those who have to work till the 31st), we are wrapping this year with the interview of a legend (in his own right) in the journalism scene of India. Yes, Rajdeep Sardesai has carved out his fanbase in his career spanning several decades. 

One day (when Rajdeep Sardesai may/may not have been in the mood for promoting his book), we sat down to have a conversation about almost all the issues/things that touch the world of journalism and contemporary socio-political realities of India.

We had a multilayered conversation about how journalism has changed over the years, the downfall of journalistic standards across domains, his double date with Salman Khan, his coverage and memories of the 1993 Mumbai riots and 2002 Gujarat riots, and much more.

Ab saare topics yahin padh loge toh video mein kya khaak mazaa aayega. Jao, enjoy karo. Nahi karoge, then it's your loss, not mine.

The Highway King of India | Nitin Gadkari Unfiltered Pro Max,"For this episode, I decided to sit with one of the 'supremes' of Indian Politics, one of the lead decision-makers in the current ruling party, and the ultimate highway king of India, Mr. Nitin Gadkari. 

Mr Gadkari hosted me in his Delhi residence on a wintery evening where we talked about his love for food, his early life as a mediocre student and his journey of becoming one of the most powerful leaders of Indian Politics. From understanding his stand on Live-in relationships, same-sex marriages & marital rapes to asking him about oxygen related deaths during covid and the Government's incompetence towards resolving the Manipur crisis, we discussed it all. 

We also talked about how Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru inspired him in many ways & how the current political scenario has deteriorated in India. From his weaknesses to his aggression issues, from Sangh to BJP, listen to all of this and more.

Ambedkar University were out of their classes to protest against their Vice Chancellor to demand the reinstatement of two professors. I decided to visit their campus to witness what a student protest in Delhi looks like, and, lo & behold, was it exciting! With Daflis and Naaras adding to the fun, the students also had some eccentric problems to share. So, experience what we experienced at the protest I wasn’t (exactly) allowed to cover.

EaWQmaFCm2c,"Manipur’s Shocking Reality, My Crazy Experience Inside the Conflict","The violence that started on 3rd May 2023, between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, triggered by disputes over Scheduled Tribe status and fears of resource dominance, has culminated into a full-fledged ethnic/civil conflict. This has claimed hundreds of lives, displaced over 60,000 people, and left families shattered.

We ventured into the relief camps on both sides, seeking to capture the unspoken anguish etched into the lives of those who endured.

To say that our experience in Manipur shook us to the core and that the sheer apathy, if not complicity of the state, has left Manipur fully divided would be a gross understatement.

It remains a real-life example of what happens when 2 identities decide to fight, when the idea of India as envisioned by our founders is perhaps ruined beyond repair, when the mind is with fear and no head dare be held high, when narrow domestic walls are erected and manipulated to break the world into tiny fragments.

It was, and remains a reminder of what happens when we decide to fight, when we choose to hate.

For this episode, I had the incredible opportunity to sit down with the filmmaker whose movies I've been watching since childhood, the films that have inspired me throughout the years, the G.O.A.T - Mr. Shyam Benegal. Witnessing the man whose contribution to Hindi cinema is nothing short of a legacy, who discovered gems like Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri, Shabana Azmi and many more, truly felt like a dream come true!

I delved into discussions about his acclaimed creations like Mandi and Bharat Ek Khoj, Directors like Guru Dutt, Satyajit Ray, the political landscape of the '70s till the Emergency, his fanciest meal and whether or not he’s a boring man. From talking about his favourite drink to tales of envy, nostalgia & navigating fame, Shyam Benegal holds nothing back. 

He even shared his opinions(and love) on Jawaharlal Nehru, his favourite Indian films, whether he prefers Coppola or Scorsese, and why he agreed to this interview (or did he??) 

I’m excited to present one of my favourite interviews, where art, nostalgia, and contemporary topics intertwine beautifully.

We discussed how he landed his first directorial gig after his hotel job in Delhi, his close relationship with elephants, Bollywood’s Parninda Parcharcha (or PNPC as he calls it) and why he lives in Kolkata after all, I got all the tea *ahem ahem* that I could.

MOf7-ZCk06g,I Went Off the Grid for 24 Hours With Kashmir’s Shepherds – Here’s the Shocking Reality,"While the rest of Kashmir is bustling with election slogans & rally traffic, life in this part of the valley seems unchanged. In an endeavour to explore the hidden corners of India, I landed up in the silent & serene mountain ranges of the Budgam district that serve as a humble abode to the shepherds of the area. This community of Shepherds get settled in their temporary homes, also known as a Doke, for 6 months along with their livestock to complete the grazing period.

The scenic views and the lush green grass are a treat to one's eyes but what lies behind all of it are the everyday struggles faced by the people of this region. They talk to me about how they have no road connectivity to shops, schools, or even hospitals. Water & electricity are a privilege and employment is nowhere to be found.

The only thing they demand from the government is 'tourism'. In the hope that tourism will, by default, provide them with employment, opportunities and basic necessities. Watch & experience the unknown world of Kunazabal in Jammu & Kashmir.

This time I parachuted from Delhi to land right in the middle of the ongoing (fiery) Jammu & Kashmir Elections to witness the madness that comes along when a state(?) experiences elections after a 10-year-long interlude! I spent a day with Omar Abdullah, my close friend, former J&K Chief Minister and Vice President of the Jammu & Kashmir National Conference for this episode. Before sitting down for a chat in his lawns (for the second time), I hijacked Omar Sahab’s shotgun seat on the way to the Ganderbal constituency for his nomination filing programme. 

I witnessed the star politician getting overwhelmed after his emotional speech to the people of Ganderbal, his “rockstar” sitting-on-the-sun-roof campaigning style, why UP’s CM is his favourite CM **wink wink** and a lot more!

We also discussed how important this election is for him, his defeat in the Baramulla constituency in the Lok Sabha Elections, the emergence of independent candidates in J&K and how he won’t give me a third interview in case he gets elected (IYKYK).

KjodhqJVFtE,"Who is Rajit Kapur? The Only Actor To Have Played Modi, Nehru and Gandhi","In a conversation that felt like a dream, I sat down with the legendary actor Rajit Kapur. His name might not ring a bell, but his contribution to Hindi Cinema is nothing less than art. Whether it's his portrayal of detective Byomkesh Bakshi in the 90s TV series or his role as a father of the spy in the 2018 film Raazi, Rajit has never failed to impress his audience.

Rajit talks about it all, from being a perennial face in Shyam Benegal movies to adapting the ever-changing medium of acting. He shares his insights on the world of theatre, his current favourite play & his most memorable experience of watching other artists perform. From being nervous before every shot to the strength he derives from his co-actors, Rajit also sheds light on his life on the film sets. 

Rajit gave me a peek into his travel diary, stories from his childhood and walked me through his life journey. But it doesn't end here. He left me with a song and that's all I needed to complete my #fan-boy moment (which was precisely the point of this whole Interview). 

So before I write everything in the description, please go ahead and watch: My Intriguing Conversation With The Only Actor To Have Played Modi, Nehru and Gandhi | Unfiltered By Samdish ft. Rajit Kapur | Powered by Woodland

Sat Sri Akal, Namaskar, Assalamualaikum, Good Morning/Evening. Arshad Warsi was in Delhi and so were we. One fine afternoon, we picked him up in our Range Rover (yeah, yeah, yeah, it was rented) and landed up in a Japanese restaurant.

और बातों का सिलसिला जो शुरू हुआ तो चलता ही गया. We talked our hearts out over Sushi and 'Japan ka glamorous bhajia'. Those 3-4 hours were a deep dive into his personality, worldview, take on cinema, aspirations, relationship with children and wife, many crazy stories, and much more (writing everything here will kill the anticipation, you know).

So, take a deep breath. Breathe in. Breathe out. And now let yourself immerse in this conversation. See you on the other side.

With Woodland on our side, presenting you the almost uncut conversation with one and only Arshad Warsi.

We landed at a Japanese-themed restaurant, and discussed his relationship with money, being a gymnast, his Amazon addiction, his encounters with Jaya Bachchan and much more.

In our Dhamaal conversation, Arshad also shared his dream of directing films, his insecurities, the loss of his parents, life at home, romance with his wife, MMF- Mixed Martial Farts and so on.

We encountered the most generous & hospitable people in the valley who, on the contrary, are struggling every day to provide for themselves.

The residents of Budgam District talked about the increased unemployment rate, school dropouts & security situation. We came across multiple villages in the district and experienced how the situation differs, but the struggles remain constant.

From being the Heaven on Earth to how far it is from an actual 'Haven', is what we have documented in this video.

While the region leaves you awestruck with its scenic hills and streams, the people of Budgam speak about the ground realities that have left the youth unemployed. From after affects of the Abrogation of Article 370 to everyday struggles with basic necessities & to still being the most generous and hospitable people we met.

From extreme poverty & illiteracy to a concerning amount of malnourishment, this village lacks basic human integrity, let alone being a 'developed society'. While highlighting the caste discrimination in the area, the villagers talked about how no government has ever paid attention to their living conditions and they have always been left behind when it comes to providing them with basic facilities like schools & hospitals. 

A day in this village felt like a time travel to the medieval era where everything depended on the caste ladder. People here do not receive electricity but are paying heavy bills, managing three meals a day is a daily struggle & when getting work is hard, begging is their only option. 

Watch & Experience as we shift the focus from the touristy side to the harsh realities of Bodh Gaya.

Banojyotsna Lahiri | Unfiltered by Samdish","While the world is witnessing one of the biggest Elections exercise, let's spare a thought for those who have been pushed to the margins of justice, conversation & society. They don't think of democracy when it is a trend to do so. Rather, they are the ones who believe in the Constitution of India and are always ready to fight to keep its spirit alive.

To push the boundaries of YouTube's political content landscape, I sat down with Dr Banojyotsna Lahiri, PhD Scholar, activist and partner of Dr Umar Khalid who has been in jail for almost 4 years. 

The conversation went from the details of Umar's case to his Amravati speech, from the media's role to public defamation. Banojyotsna also shared some beautiful stories about their 'long-distance relationship' and her weekly meetings with Umar in Tihar jail.

In the middle of the heated campaigning, I went to Hyderabad to spend a day with four-time sitting MP Asaduddin Owaisi for this episode. Before we sat down for a chat, Mr Owaisi offered me a ride on his fancy Triumph bike to witness his door-to-door campaigning in his constituency. 

We discussed how tough this election is for him, the new BJP candidate contesting against him and how hopeful he is in this election. Apart from trying and failing to find out what Mr Owaisi does to ‘chill’ in a Halal way, we also discussed the relationship between the state and religion, BJP’s politics, and Mr Owaisi’s hypocrisies. 

Mr Owaisi also opened up about three assassination attempts on him, his workout routine and why he thinks therapy is not for politicians.

Tighten your seat belts because this episode is a laughter ride. Presenting Unfiltered by Samdish ft. Asaduddin Owaisi.

Witness the majje of Samdish inside the AAP's Chief Minister's husband Arvind Kejriwal's wife Sunita Kejriwal's roadshow in Delhi during the Lok Sabha General Elections, 2024!

Walking inside the rally, he got a chance to interact with some really knowledgeable OG aunties-uncles, danced like baraati and witnessed underarms.

And all this started (cough cough) with that one message shared by Producer Kartik, and everyone's reply to that was ""Chalein?""

What do you do when you (being a proud South Delhi resident) are invited to the dinners that political parties throw to woo the residents of posh colonies in South Delhi? 

As an active citizen (and a content creator) I decided to get bloated from the varieties of pakwaan served by AAP and BJP (and reviewed it for you guys).

AAP aur BJP ka food review video banane ke liye, you need:
Ameer log: 6 - 7 Tbsp
Party neta: 3 - 4 Fresh pieces 
Gulab jamun: 1 Each
Acchi acchi baatein: Jee bhar ke
Samdish ka tadka: Swaad anusar

From dissecting the themes of AAP and BJP campaigns to reviewing food, experience this 'rich people' party campaign with one and only Samdusht.      

While I am figuring out what works for this country and my stomach, now it's your responsibility to watch the video and make the decision.

Si-n78Jzfro,Inside Ladakh's Protest for Full Statehood with Sonam Wangchuk | Unfiltered by Samdish,"The people of Ladakh have been protesting for months to demand the 6th schedule & full statehood for Ladakh. Headed by education reformist Sonam Wangchuk, Ladakhis are trying to convey the on-ground reality and plight to the Central Government and remind the ruling party of their promises.

We documented the situation more closely where people explained not just the importance of these demands but also talked about their rights, the fear they hold if none of this is fulfilled, their helplessness, and above all, the hope they still have from the Government.

From beautiful Landscapes to fear of losing everything, watch and experience these few days at a Protest in Ladakh.

fPP_3XCXbPQ,The Prashant Kishor Interview | Samdish x PK,"For this episode, I went to Bihar’s Begusarai to interview Prashant Kishor during his ongoing Jan Suraaj Padyatra. 

PK, who has left the path of political strategy, is now claiming to be on a mission to help the people of Bihar, fix its politics and transform the condition of Bihar. 

On the sides of his Padyatra, I sat down with PK to discuss his vision for Bihar, his intimate relationships with PM Modi and CM Nitish Kumar, who is funding Jan Suraaj and if they are going to contest Lok Sabha Elections?

Apart from following Gandhi, who does PK look up to and does he ever feel guilty for helping a politician win in the past. From PK’s never seen before laugh, screen time and therapy, we covered it all. Presenting, My Crazy Day Inside Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Yatra.

IOrZRusUWOU,छत / Roof | Bharat Ek Khoj - Episode 4 | An Evening In The Hills Of Himachal Pradesh,"In Himachal Pradesh, a state known for its stunning landscapes and traditional architecture, the construction of roofs involves a combination of traditional building methods and materials that are suitable for the local climate. 

In our visit, we came across a daily wage labourer who constructs roofs for a living. From wooden mansions in big cities to small houses in rural villages, he builds ceilings for different kinds of homes. This video is a glimpse into a few minutes of his life at work.

This video was first published on 'On Ground by Samdish' on the 9th of November, 2022. To ensure 'Bharat Ek Khoj' reaches you with utmost ease, we are re-publishing it here.

TbgqRGko6Xg,I Investigated The Opposition's Protest Against Suspension of MPs | Jantantra Episode 3,"As you might know (Sabko Pata Nahi Hota Laxman!), 146 MPs were suspended from both Houses of Parliament over the past week for demanding a statement from Home Minister Amit Shah about a security breach that happened on December 13 when two intruders stormed the chamber by jumping from the visitors' gallery and releasing yellow smoke canisters.

These suspended MPs belong to opposition parties, which have formed an alliance, I.N.D.I.A, to take on the BJP in the 2024 General Elections. So opposition parties decided to protest against the suspension of MPs and we decided to attend the protest. Hence the video and the description (Koi padhta hai kya ye?...comments me batao).

So, experience what we experienced at the ""Save Democracy"" protest (or should I say Congress rally) at Jantar Mantar. Yo!

For the first episode of Unfiltered By Samdish, Congrade Kanhaiya Kumar and I decided to sit down for a chat. We spoke about his decision to join the Congress, the ""deal"" he made with Rahul Gandhi, his dislike for shahi tukda and why I won’t share my Netflix password with him.  Poori video zarur dekhna!

We're just looking to create amazing content and break the internet every now and then. I often interview politicians, celebrities, gatecrash election rallies and also explore my own country by reporting from the ground. This is an experiment for us as well and we really want to be able to sustain ourselves without being too dependent on the factors that determine the content market, especially on Youtube. Dekhte hain, mazaa hi aaega :)
Woooohooo!
